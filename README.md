### Please note that this repository contains various multimedia files

Read the Notary Node Election Bible [here.](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dPoW/blob/dev/doc/bible.md)

Please note, for Season 5 make sure you proposals conform to the bible, specifically

```
Notary nodes achieving a regional top 3 ranking at the ranking snapshot date are automatically re-elected to operate that node in the next season.

Notary nodes achieving a regional top 5 ranking are eligible to submit a candidacy for an additional notary node for each region they held a top 5 position in at the ranking snapshot date.

Notary nodes who are not in their regional top 5 at the end of the season can reapply for a single node in each of the region(s) they served in during the previous season.

No notary can hold more than 2 nodes in a single region, or more than 6 nodes in total.
```
