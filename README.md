QR codes for voting addresses will be generated and added to the `qr_codes` folder by the Komodo platform team, but if you would like to include them in your PR, use `qrencode <VOTE_ADDRESS> -s 8 -t PNG -o <CANDIDATE>_<REGION>.png` to generate them in the required format.

Fancy QR codes for your proposal can be included in your proposal folder e.g. [decker_AR](decker/RWLtG5n97g5dJFvn9zhxU7QBvTmJ2BqKyw.svg).
