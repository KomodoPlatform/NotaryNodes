NOTARY NODE ELECTION 2022
VOTE FOR ROADRUNNER

About me
I have 10+ years experience as a IT professional. I'm a full stack developer main areas are Oracle SQL, MS SQL, MySQL, Java, .NET, PHP, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. Recently exploring node.js, Redis and Mongodb in creation of a gitter bot from scratch and a few other projects. In my career I also played the roles of a Network Administrator I (CCNA & CCNP) and Project Manager II.

I'd like the opportunity to become a notary node operator as I'm a true believer in the platform and have convinced countless number of users to purchase and mine KMD. Iâ€™ve joined the crypto scene almost a year ago and quickly adapted to KMD, have been mining and purchasing ever since. Regardless of voting outcome I will still continue to express the value that the KMD platform brings to crypto.
