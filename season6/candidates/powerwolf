About Me

I'm a Linux systems administrator with around 20 years of experience. In my early career, I was one of the first Internet Service Providers in my neighborhood in Bucharest/Romania. After years and a lot of nice experiences working in my own ISP Business, in 2015 i bought my first 4 BTC. Since then, I studied a lot about Bitcoin, Blockchain tech, and I foused on a few of those bleeding edge technologies and projects like Komodo.
