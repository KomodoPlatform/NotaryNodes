# Notary Node elections 2022

See below for an overview of the currently active proposals for the 2022 Notary Node election.
To participate in the elections:

1. Upload your proposal before May 11 2022 (00:00 UTC) into this repository using a folder with your operator name containing a `README.md` file. Check the other proposals and ones from previous elections for an example.
2. Don't make any changes to this file in it in your PRs - the repo maintainers will update it once your proposal is accepted.

Make sure to read the [Notary Node Election Bible](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dPoW/blob/dev/doc/bible.md) for more information about election rules and notary node duties.

Each proposal must include:
- The region(s) you are entering the elections to win. New candidates are limited to a single region, and incumbent notaries will be advised regarding additional eligibility based on previous season rankings.
- A voting address for each region you will be running for election in
- Your name and contact details (e.g. your discord username), and if running as part of a team or project, the name and contact details of other team members. 
- Specifications of servers you will be using if you win a spot.
- Two pubkeys which you will use to run your notary nodes in season 6. These must be securely generated and stored in a safe place!

Optional, but recommended:
- A short bio covering your skills/experience and any notable contributions you've made within the Komodo EcoSystem
- Details of any funding allocations to projects your node will support if elected.
