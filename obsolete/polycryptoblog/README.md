<h1> Polycryptoblog's Notary Node Proposal 2018 </h1>

Hello, I am Polycryptoblog,  I am a Komodo Team Member, Admin at Crypto Warriors and candidate in the 2018 Notary Node Elections.
I am currently a Notary Node Operator for the North America quadrant and am looking to seek election in the Southern Hemisphere and Asia/Russia quadrants to further real world integration and developments in Komodo ecosystem.

As a notary node operator I have used funds derived from Notary mining to pay for:

Komodo Integration with Coinpayments.net -  allowing merchants to accept Komodo in their stores.

Conference Materials for the Bitcoin SuperConference in Texas as well as some materials for a conference in Barcelona

Have a Komodo History Book written: https://www.amazon.com/Komodo-Fuel-SuperNET-Concise-History/dp/1981831452/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1520984921&sr=8-1&keywords=komodo+fuel+the+supernet

Advertising 

Bounties.

Additionally I have pledged to use the remaining notary node funds to set up masternodes to help fund BarterDEX liquidity, after the election has concluded,  in lieu of running a Komodo sweepstakes website.  However, not being one to leave a good idea unfinished this year I would like to work with the CryptoWarriors group in getting a official legal giveaway/sweepstakes site up and running to further acquaint newcomers into crypto.

<h3>2018 Notary Node Election Proposal:</h3>

If I were to win additional notary node spots I propose to use the income for:

1) Helping CryptoWarriors get their coin established and integrated into Agama wallet and sweepstakes site running
2) Creating a business in the Komodo ecosystem that helps bridge the gap between the digital and real world.
3) Creating generators of liquidity for BarterDEX
4) Advertising and Bounties.
