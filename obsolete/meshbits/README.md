## [](#tl-dr)TL;DR

[Satinder Grewal] and [Nitin Sharma] are teaming up under the name **Meshbits** to help grow and support the **[Komodo community]**.

Satinder has been contributing by solving various problems for the community, by dissipating knowledge and by delivering on his promises such as BarterDex.
And now by using his personal funds for running **electrumx servers** and notary nodes.

Nitin has volunteered his time to setup stable, automated quality infrastructure for the network.

We intend to invest the revenue from notary node operations in growing the Komodo echo system and therefore **we are contesting in Notary Node 2018 elections.**

## [](#what-we-offer)What Meshbits Offer

At Meshbits, we mainly think from a **developer's point of view** and understand where Komodo Platform has room for improvement. Having the capability to do development and create tools and applications to improve the Komodo Platform allows Meshbits team to use it's skillset and funds in the most efficient way possible.

Meshbits will use all the earnings made from Komodo Platform Notary Nodes mining for the following:

* Scripts and toolset for Developers which will help creating independent projects from scratch using Komodo Platform technologies.
* Creating Decentralised Applications based on Komodo Platform technologies.
* Contributing to improve Komodo Platform Infrastructure experience wherever possible. The recent example is the addition of SPV servers which are being voluntarily provided to the Komodo community.
* Creating & maintenance of **Developer oriented documentation** for Komodo Platform technologies.

Instead of offering percentage of our Notary Nodes to our voters, we use these funds to increase the value of Komodo tokens by dedicating our skillset to improve Komodo Platform. That itself increases the underlying value of all KMD cryptocurrency.

It's the developer made applications and services which put a cryptocurrency in demand, due to their use cases. And Meshbits team has the capability to deliver what we promise.

We hope the Komodo Platform users will chose Meshbits and give us the opportunity to not just give the value to our voters only but to the entire Komodo community.
