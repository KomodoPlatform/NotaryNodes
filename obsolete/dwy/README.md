# Dwy Notary Node Proposal

You want to participate to 2018 Notary Node elections but still don't know who you'll vote for ?
Here's my [proposal](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/vote2018/blob/master/proposals/dwy/Dwy-Notary-Candidate-EU.pdf).


## 4 Reasons to vote for me  :

 **1. One Candidate : One Node**
I truly believe that 64 Nodes should mean 64 different Operators, That's the core of decentralization, and more operators leads to stronger consensus.

 **2. 30% of mining will be shared with voters**
 Why ? Just because I believe we're just at the beginning of crypto awareness, and even in case of  a massive price drop, I can afford to maintain 1 working node without any problem.
In case price skyrocket, people participating to this journey voting for me should be rewarded accordingly.

 **3. Independent believer**
 I am NOT affiliated to any official team or partnerlist, that means I'm on my own, not having anything more than my personal investments. No conflict of interest, ever.

 **4. Technical skills**
 Got 10+ years of experience as System Engineer, and have web coding skills. My **node is already running**, and is hosted at a top rated Datacenter, that means i already invested and my proposal is not based on : "If I win, I'll host it for real, in the meantime, I wait".

## About election process

KMD Notary Nodes elections, for 2018 have **no limitations about how much region candidates can participate. This point, to me, should change**, I'm aware that I'm facing a lot of official members, partners, or multiregion candidates, yet I believe there is a need for more people involved in notary tasks. If you believe in KMD ecosystem, just ask yourself : **Do I want to rely on a group of 20, or a group of 60** when the term "consensus" and "decentralize" comes into play?
