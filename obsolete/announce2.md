# Notary nodes season 2019-2020

For the season 2019-2020 we will have 64 nodes. 32 nodes will be elected based on VOTE2019 token, 4 nodes are kept for team dev purposes. 28 nodes will be automaticly re-elected based on notarization counts: total nodes score is number of KMD->BTC notarizations, plus 1/3 of number of assets->KMD notarizations done.

VOTE2019 token will be airdropped 14th. April, based on KMD chain snapshot (of the same date). You will get VOTe2019 token 1:1 as seen at all transparent KMD R- addresses. If you want to get VOTE2019 tokens - make sure your KMD are stored at your own wallet (where you own WIF/seed) and not on any exchange by the end of day April 13th.
