## BIOGRAPHY ##

ChainZilla is a project that was launched in June 2018 to facilitate blockchain onboarding and app development on Komodo Platform and serveral other networks.

Since our launch we have re-designed and developed several applications in order to make it easy to launch a blockchain and manage an ICO. Some of these tools include a mobile wallet, paper wallet tool, and a faucet. We are currently working on the expansion of Chameleon Pay and a new payment processor that will allow us to offer different services to our clients. 

Some of the projects that work with ChainZilla include Komodo, NEM, NIX, Pundix, and Groestlcoin. Early in 2019 we launched [LABFin](https://labfin.io), a foundation to foment blockchain development in Panama and Latin America.
