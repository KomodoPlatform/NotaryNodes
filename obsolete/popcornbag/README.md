<b>About Me:</b>

I have background in System Administration for about 18 years and have worked mainly in banks and telecom.
I started in crypto some years ago mining alts with GPU and since 2016 I've join komodo since its bird when the project was in testnet and was able
to get 2 nodes elected.<br>

I will keep supporting the Komodo project has needed with hardware upgrades and more scalability solutions for the needed future of grow in assetchains and ElectrumX servers to improve
the user experience on the plataform.
