## About Me

I am a UNIX systems engineer/administrator with around 20 years of experience in UNIX. Earlier this year i quit my last job to be able to concentrate on the Komodo Project even more.

During my professional carreer, i was with 3 different employers:

* Server Hosting/Housing company
* ATC (air traffic control) software and hardware supplier
* German public ('state') television

I started off in the crypto universe as a simple miner. My first contact with Komodo was end of 2016, when swaps from BTCD to KMD were made possible for the first time. My main interest was BarterDEX, so i started setting it up, testing and reporting bugs. I integrated most of the now available coins into BarterDEX and am now running 2 servers providing 'basic' liquidity for all listed coins. I'm also operating 6 separate electrum servers on AWS for BarterDEX, and have successfully integrated some coins in ElectrumX-code.

In case i will be elected to run one or more nodes, i will invest a good part of the income of the nodes back into hardware upgrades for the aforementioned ElectrumX servers.
