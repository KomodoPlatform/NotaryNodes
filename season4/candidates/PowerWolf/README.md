About Me

I'm a Linux systems administrator with around 18 years of experience.
In my early career, I was one of the first Internet Service Providers in my neighborhood in Bucharest/Romania.
After years and a lot of nice experiences working in my own ISP Business, in 2015 i bought my first 4 BTC (Thanks to my actual wife for the support ;).
Since then, I studied a lot about Bitcoin, Blockchain, and I foused on a few of those bleeding edge technologies and projects like Komodo.
Komodo is/was one of my favorite projects.I also like solid projects like SKY (Skycoin), LBTC (BTC Lightning Network), FXC (Flexacoin), ETC (Ethereum Classic), EOS, Steem, Golem or DOGE ;) .
I also mined ethereum with a few rigs since it was quoted around 2-5 USD.
Now, I use some trading bots on diffrent CEX and some DEX markets or investment platforms like the romanian project venbot.io .
