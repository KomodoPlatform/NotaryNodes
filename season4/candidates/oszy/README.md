# Oszy 
***Notary Node Election 2020 Proposal***

## Region: EU (UK)
```Vote Address EU: RVoteNNv5rDWH8iMVkjhnJVZJUr7UNtMd3```

### Who Am I?
Many of you may already know me from Slack/Discord, 

I am a technology enthusiast ever since I can remember.

My day-to-day jobs were Back-end Web Development, Technical Support, IT System Administration, and Search Engine Marketing. 

---
I have joined the blockchain evolution in 2017, Komodo was one of the first projects I took interest in, seeing the technical knowledge and the dedication of their team, I knew it will be a great place to start and learn about blockchain.  I wasn't disappointed, right after I discovered the community, we had the atomic swap stress test, which at the time was a very technical test for me, and taught me a lot of new things.  Thus I am forever grateful to this community for everything I learned and for what We will accomplish together.

### What I do

As of today, I am a Community Moderator of **Komodo**, and a First Mate in **[PirateChain](https://pirate.black/)**.
In addition to the moderator role, I volunteer in Komodo and Blockchain related technical support, and community testing.
I am one of the Notary Node operators in [KMDLabs](http://kmdlabs.io/), Komodo's incubation and testing environment for developing Komodo-based Smart Chains and custom Antara modules. 

### Why am I running for the election?

I do feel that I have the technical knowledge and experience to run a Notary Node, as well as I am committed to supporting the ecosystem as much as I possibly can. 
I would like to further increase my experience and be part of the core of this community.

### Hardware

I am going to have 2 dedicated servers ***on time*** (Main and 3rd party) with the following or better specifications:

**CPU**

Intel Xeon  4c/8t - 3.5GHz/3.9GHz

**RAM**

64GB DDR4 

**Disk**

2× 1920GB SSD NVMe Raid

### Pledges

As I said, my main goal is to support the ecosystem therefore I am pledging the following amounts from my monthly Notary Node earnings to the following projects if I get elected. 

**To PirateChain: 10%**

**To KMDLabs: 10%**

**To the Komodo Team for Community Bounties / Marketing  / Development:  5/5/5 = 15%**


***I do not  offer  reward distribution to voters, as I am strongly against “buying votes” sorry. 
The above pledges may increase/decrease depending on KMD Fiat price at the time to make sure I can cover the server costs.***


**Disclaimer**

I am not part of the official Komodo Team and I do not currently have a Komodo Notary Node.
Thank you for reading my proposal, and hope you will give me a chance to prove myself, and give your VOTE on me!
