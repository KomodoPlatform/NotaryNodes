SH: `RJWsMTusioGR1S9AdQiHkBrKovee5akvpH`

### Proposal

Who I am
- I've been a part of SuperNET / Komodo for 6 years, where I mostly helped test the barterdex / marketmaker protocol,
- I am a software developer with a CS background and have experience with Rust, Java, JS, React, Bash, Python
- I'm part of Chainmakers where I helped several clients with implementing Komodo technology

What I've been working on
- Rust API implementation of Komodo daemon API
- Command Line Interface for Marketmakers: [link](https://github.com/jorian/kamel)
- several other Rust apps, see [my github](https://github.com/jorian).
- the development of a GUI for marketmaker 2.0, [Chainswap](https://github.com/chainmakers/Chainswap/releases)
- Being a marketmaker on the new mm2.0 on several different pairs

Why me?  
With the funds that I get from being a Notary, I can provide for myself and give more of my time to the development of Komodo platform. Things I like and plan to do in the coming year:

- help develop the [HyperDEX app](https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex) and extend the app with Komodo Antara tech;
- develop more tools for marketmakers;
- help Chainmakers and its clients, and get more clients through Chainmakers;

### Node information

SH node:
- Intel Xeon processor
- 64 DDR4 RAM
- 1TB NVMe

## Disclaimer

I am not part of the Komodo Platform Team; I work together with siu on Chainmakers where we help people / businesses getting set up their own blockchain on the Komodo Platform. In the past, we helped OOT, EQL, GLXT, PIRATE, ILN and others.
