## **Hi!**

We are Soldat and _lua, both long-time supporters of Komodo project and today candidates for being Komodo Notary Node operators in EU region.

### Soldat

Passionate about nature, computers, new technologies, finance and literature. Since my encounter with Bitcoin (early 2013) I have developed a vision entirely based on sharing, freedom and control and possession of digital data. I am following jl777 closely since NXT, then BTCD and finally Komodo. I am today an official Komodo's French ambassador: a consultant for people and companies interested in the platform, and for those who want to know more or start developing on it. I facilitate them the comprehension and approach of this recent and complex technology.

## **Why vote for us?**

We have set the goal to get more and more involved in Komodo projects development and promotion. Running a NN would be a great sign of appreciation from the Komodo community and a valuable distinction for working with our partners.  

So far we participated in conferences and gave presentations in French computer science schools (Epitech, Ecole 42...) but also within companies, at VERTUOZE Congress in Lille dedicated to BIM & SMARTBUILDING where we introduced how the blockchain and Komodo works.
With Soldat as coordinator, we aim to touch a larger audience in public and private events with new conferences and presentations, but also by writing / translating articles and be more involved in the Komodo community.

## **System specs**

We plan to run 2 dedicated servers with the following **minimal** specifications:

- OS: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS  
- CPU: IntelÂ® XeonÂ® E3 1245 v5  
- RAM: 64 Go DDR4  
- Disk: 1To SSD  
- Bandwidth: 300 Mbit/s  

## **Vote details**

- Region: Europe (EU)
- Voting address: `RXp516twdbr15YBj79HrXfifid4PiRVZhi`
