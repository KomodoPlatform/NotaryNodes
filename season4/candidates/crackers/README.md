Hello fellow KMD supporters!

I previously operated 2 notary nodes in season 1/2 and hope to provide notary services this year.

With the growing demand to secure PoW chains, my nodes this year will be running in a custom private cloud to provide more effective and efficent notarizations and to support more external chains.

I have also been running a stable and successful pool for 5+ years: zpool.ca, My pool offers payouts in hundreds of coins including KMD as well as several dPoW supported chains.
