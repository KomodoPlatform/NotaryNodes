## Presentation

Hello. My name is Antonin, and I would like to candidate for a notary position on your ecosystem.

### Experiences

I am a devops, mainly working on infrastructure projects for my employers.
I mainly use python on my everyday's tasks as it is reliable, fast to deploy, and can run on pretty much anything.


## **Why vote for me?**

At the moment, my carreer is too much weighted on project and team management, and because I would like to come back to my roots, and I have a strong appetite for blockchain stuff I discovered in 2016, I think being part of the team would put me back on track, and allow me to do what I like the most.
I discovered KMD at first when I was researching about atomic swaps, and started following the news since then, but never had the guts to candidate.

Today, here I am.
