2020 Ambitions
==============
* Deployment strategies to facilitate onboarding & collaboration
* Technical news
* Rust (maybe 2021)
* Antara module

Notary History
==============
I ran the komodopioneers notary node in S2, getting auto re-elected for S3. In S3, the Pioneers team had 2 nodes, however the performance of these nodes could not be maintained through my work schedule, illness & recovery. Pioneers teamwork in participating in the meetup scene is aligned with my values, however due to my personal goals, require the notary to subsist independently within the ecosystem in S4.

During S3, 50% of any hunting bonus mining income was sent to the Agama hack address to reimburse jl777 as support for his compassionate funding of the community losses.

Komodo Experience
=================
I collaborated with the Komodo team and worked on the rebrand. I wrote approximately 35 "[Tech Tuesday](https://komodoplatform.com/tech-tuesday-update/)" blog posts for Komodo in 2018 & 2019 whilst participating in phases of the new technology - [scaling to 800k payments on amazon infrastructure](https://medium.com/@imylomylo/komodo-blockchain-scaling-ec5d1b7af9c8), all-in-one docker images for Antara documentation.

Deployment strategies
=====================
I continued my last unfinished collaboration with Komodo to create orderbook.live and it has a downloadable all-in-one distribution on dockerhub still in development. This model of redistribution can be reimplemented for other jl777 tech, including chips & Pangea poker, nspv compatible apps and more, as a means of lowering the barrier to use Komodo tech for preview & promotion, especially on short notice or for meet ups.

This attitude led to community collaboration during the scaling tests & may provide for testnet versions of Komodo stablecoin applications.

Technical News
==============
We (Mylo & Ahmed) publish articles on cryptocurrency & Komodo at https://ikomodo.com - signposted supporting posts for the community to gain richer insights into how & what is significant in the Komodo developosphere.

Antara module development & HyperDEX
=====================================
I have a good understanding of the UTXO & Antara systems to be curious to develop some mechanics for blockchain use cases, particular with DTO & games. HyperDEX updates may also fall into this category later in 2020.

About me
==========
I am Mylo, freelance veteran. I have 20+ years experience in computing in telecommunications protocol development & service delivery, online learning systems & social outreach using technology to communicate ideas & collaborate globally (before social media or github existed).
