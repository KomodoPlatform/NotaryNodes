First time I learned about Bitcoin was late 2013 from one of my college friends. Started mining on Radeon GPU a few weeks after that and made my first Bitcoin within a month. Since then I became absolutely facinated by blockchain technology and its use cases. Learned about Komodo a year ago. Really like that the platform is developer oriented and highly active on Github. I think it has bright future and can become a major player in the following years. In my spare time I also like to fiddle with eletronics mostly repair and bring back to life old phones, cameras, tv, laptops etc.
