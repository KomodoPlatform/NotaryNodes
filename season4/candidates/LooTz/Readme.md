Who’s Lootz?
My name is LooTz, I believe we need to change this world through technology and bravery. I have been with Komodo since its first days. I created the first SuperNET website and ran SuperNET Radio, which is now renamed to CryptoRadio.Live. With over 250 interviews, my Crypto Show has been downloaded thousands of times.

I co-founded CryptoCoreMedia.com, a premier crypto information website, and marketing service. While I am primarily the resident SEO guru for CryptoCoremedia.com, my skill set also includes web development, content creation, CryptoRadio.Live hosting and most of all the “creator of magical opportunities”.

I have boarded the Pirate Ship and naturally became a Pirate myself. I did this because I believe in privacy and in the strength of the Komodo ecosystem. In collaboration with other pirates, I have made the following contributions towards Pirate Chain: Pirate OS (thank You to Wieprz), Pruner Code (thank you to Forge and MrLynch), Mobile Wallet (thank you to Forge, MrLynch, CHMEX, PWNZ), and several more collaborations I cannot disclose at this time.

I aim to be a champion of the Komodo ecosystem by running a notary node. As a tech specialist for over 30 years, I believe in the gradual and constant improvement of the node. Ultimately, this will create redundancy for lower downtime risks overtime.

Our Team:
Our Notary Node team also includes theekgb. who is an expert in systems engineering, monitoring, and automation technologies. He has been involved in systems engineering and DevOps for 7 years, IT systems for 20 years and blockchain for over 2 years. He is very passionate about Komodo. While he is not active publicly, he has been involved in several Komodo technology projects behind the scenes.

“ I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I would like to help everyone if possible. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world, there is room for everyone, and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical; our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost. The airplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men; cries out for universal brotherhood; for the unity of us all.”~Chaplin
