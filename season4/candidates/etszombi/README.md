# 2020 ELECTIONS FOR KOMODO NODE 

Hi everyone. My nickname is Etszombi. I have been working for the Komodo community as a notary in three nodes, SoutAfrica, Europe and Asian Region. 
I would like to contribute with my experience, my hardworking and my knowledgement. 
Daily I connect to all my servers to update and do everything the komodo team ask me to.
It is a big pleasure to continue being member of this great team and I need your votes in order to carry this out.
Here you have my wallets if you eventually decide to vote for them.

My node in Europe has been working all year long with a lot of success and being elected directly. Hope to have more than one node working at the same time.
