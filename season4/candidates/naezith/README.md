## About me
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2Op0b8h.jpg" align="left">

I'm Tolga Ay, graduated from *Computer Engineering*, *Yildiz Technical University*. During my education, I solely developed and published my own game *[Remnants of Naezith](https://store.steampowered.com/app/590590)* from scratch with C++ without using a game engine.

At Q4 2018, I joined [Komodo Team](https://komodoplatform.com/about-komodo/) as *Senior C++ & MERN Fullstack Blockchain Developer*. 

With the guidance of *[ca333](https://twitter.com/0xca333)*, I single-handedly developed my first project, *[Antara Smart Chain Composer](https://composer.kmd.io/)*. 

Afterwards, being duo with *[Slyris](https://github.com/milerius)*, we made *[Antara Gaming SDK](https://youtu.be/k1vNYGzpHZ8)* and now we are proudly developing *[atomicDEX Pro](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Pro)*.

I am like a Swiss Army knife which can obtain extra tools if needed. 

At my leisure time, I like to polish my game, tinker with electronics, and play competitive FPS games.
