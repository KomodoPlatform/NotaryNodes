## Komodo notary node candidate rz1911 for SH region

Hello. My name is rz1911. Currently I work as a datacenter engineer in Singapore. My IT carrier started in the early 90s were I began coding ASM and cracking software for various warez groups. I also dabbled with BTX decoderz and some IBM phone lines ;) Later on I had fun managing warez topsites in EU and ASiA as a sysop/gadmin. All of this eventually lead to a real world job and quiet good pay so my scene time became more and more limited. I still value digital piracy and privacy strongly and want to get back into helping the (crypto)scene. I got to know the Komodo project via a ping from jeezy couple years back and have been following it on and off for quiet some time now. Dukeleto and jeezy wanted to onboard me on Team Chainstrike which eventually didnt happen. Now that I got into the scene and followed it for a while I think I can provide valuable experience and knowledge as a sysop. I would appreciate you voting for me on the upcoming election, thank you.
