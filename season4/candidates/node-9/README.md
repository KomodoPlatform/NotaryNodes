### How to participate

Information on how the NN elections work and how to vote can be found on the [Komodo website, here](https://komodoplatform.com/fourth-annual-notary-node-election/) and in the [Notary Bible](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dPoW/blob/master/doc/bible.md).  One KMD earns one vote token. It is possible to send portions of your vote tokens to multiple candidates. 



# Proposal

### Region: EU

### Purpose

As a Komodo EU Notary I will focus on notarizing.  I will also support others in doing the same.  I believe that what we are creating here with Komodo is a very important step in the right direction.  As such, I take the responsibility of the role of Notary Node operator very seriously.

  
### Method

I will reliably put in the time and effort to do the best job I can possibly do.  This means being available when needed for updates, support and for active participation in the notary node community.  It also means I will do my best to improve my skills and hardware continually throughout the entire one year term.  Although these concepts may sound trivial and common, they are in fact not.  I believe my record, found through search or by asking around, will show that I am capable and willing to make this happen.


### Means

Through the use of a network of support I have developed and with the experience, skills and knowledge I have gained as a Komodo Notary Node operator in Season 3 I will continue to contribute to th NN community. I am not a dev or a very technical person but I have found out where and how to find and implement solutions to technical problems.
