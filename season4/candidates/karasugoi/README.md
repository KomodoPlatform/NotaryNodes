## Who am I?
Hello, I am the operator of the node karasugoi_NA. I have been helping to run the network behind Komodo from the beginning testnet days. I love Komodo for our tech, and for our community. I have been invested in KMD since our ICO and will remain a long-term hodler. I have also been a steady reliable Notary Node operator from the beginning and am proud of our accomplishments as a community. We had some rough times in season three and have lost some of our node operators due to the stress of the commitment.  I will remain committed to my node and our network.

## Why Vote for karasugoi?
- My dedication to komodo community and network, I have been there from the start.
- I helped, and will continue to support komodo Labs (500 KMD in season 3, more planned in season 4). 
- I helped (by sending 1000 KMD) and will continue to help defray some of the massive cost taken on by Jl777 when he made our community members whole after the hacker’s theft of our funds.
- I faithfully update my node. We have several current operators (28 nodes worth) that don’t bother updating with the latest notarizing code. We can’t keep our network functioning optimally this way. Please don’t pick non-active operators for your voting.        
- I follow our network all the time (travel and vacations included) with a dedicated computer.
- I will only run one node, and believe that is the best for the health of our network. We need dedicated and numerous operators, concentrating our nodes into the hands of only a few multi-node operators is risky. Vote for decentralizing our operators for a the health of Komodo and our community.
