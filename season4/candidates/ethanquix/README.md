## Who am i ?

I have been working for a friend working on Komodo since July 2019, and supporting the project since 2017.
I'm now a lead developer a company havin abolutely no letter in common with Komodo. 
I am a backend developer expert in `HTML`, `Css`, `Pohtoshop`
I enjoy making plugins for my coffee machine in `C++`, `Go` and `Python`
I play with Lego since my childhood (and with code since my parents stopped buying me Lego...).
I am also passionate about Blockchain, to be more serious, I first discovered Ethereum and have been interested to any crypto related project since.
  To me it's more a new ideology which can change the world for the better, improve access to multiple services for people on earth and enabling them to participate and shape the future.

## Komodo Involvment

Since Yesterday I have made 2 important advices to the Komodo platform (2 in 1 day... imagine what I can do if I am elected)
1. I have suggested that if you send some Komodo to every voting adress 10sec before the voting process, everyone will be banned from the process as say in the rule
2. MY code is already merged with this repository from the KomodoPlatorm: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes

## Why me?
- I love to help people in my region, a platform like Komodo will grow much much faster with people who enjoy giving time to other
- I will organize some meetup in SF if anybody is interested, to me meetups have always been a fantastic way to share our passion and knowledge
- I will organize little contest each month linked with a Komodo utilization and a theme (eg: Make a re-design of the Logo generated with the komodo blockchain), the community will vote for winners which will receive a part of my earnings. (The other part will go directly toward my ramen consumption (and red wine))
