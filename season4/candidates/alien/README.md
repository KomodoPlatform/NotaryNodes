## Who am I?
Blockchain enthusiast, been with the community since BTCD mining days. Komodo lover, long-term hodler and a reliable Notary Node operator for the last 2 seasons and a NN Guru now. I run my nodes with high-end servers and no compromise on that. Also monitor the nodes and network constantly. With experience on Komodo, iguana and Linux systems, along with operating my nodes, I try to help other operators who needs help. I help the Komodo ecosystem by testing new tech and reporting any issues found to make things better.

## Why Vote alien?
- Long term Komodo supporter and hodler.
- Top Notary Notary operator out of all 4 regions in season 2 and season 3. #1 in ranking in the respective AR and EU region and #1 & #2 globally. You can check the stats [here](https://komodostats.com/nn).
- I put network security as priority before the server cost or anything else.
- I test all new core tech that Komodo develops and write the easy to follow testing guides for others. Some of my guides:
