## About Me

I am a UNIX systems engineer/administrator with around 20 years of experience.

During my professional carreer, i was with 3 different employers:

* Server Hosting/Housing company
* ATC (air traffic control) software and hardware supplier
* German public ('state') television

I am part of the Komodo team, running a couple of servers, like:

* Electrumx servers for dozens of coins
* AtomicDEX marketmaker nodes (providing liquidity)
* AtomicDEX seed nodes (orderbooks and swap statistics)
* parity/geth nodes for AtomicDEX ERC20 tokens
* monitoring server (icinga)

I use my own [trading bot](https://github.com/cipig/mmtools) on the AtomicDEX marketmaker nodes and also on a couple CEXs.
