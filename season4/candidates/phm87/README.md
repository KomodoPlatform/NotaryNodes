I'm candidate to be Notary Node during the 2020-2021 season in order to continue to contribute to iguana (stopcoin, pausecoin, few fixes), enhance notary scripts, support/enhance komodo and ecosystem projects, contribute to AtomicDEX/mm2 (integration into yiimp ongoing, Lightning Network submarine swaps integration) and maybe launch and support other projects (auto-exchange pool, run komodo on ARM hardware, HSM integration for iguana & yiimp). I am planning to use the Notary Node earnings to support these projects. About testing my iguana changes, I may ask to have a 3P Dev node in addition (in order to avoid to alter my official mainet stats).

I tested many things on my phm87_SH node during the 2019-2020 season: my notarization performances were sometimes in the top 3 and sometimes very low. Whatever many notary nodes were impressed by these performances, my node was not re-elected.

KMD Team was very kind and created recently a phm87 branch for my contirbutions to Komodo. I was very pleased to have open-mindid discussions with jl777 about Lightning Network, Komodo and some technical aspects of crypto. I was very happy to give additional support to KMDLabs, Chips, WLC21 and other projects.

During 2019-2020 season, I gave 20% of my KMD mined to Chips and 20% to KMDLabs (so I gave 40% in total). If I am elected, I will give some of my KMD earnings to some projects but less than 40%.

Big thank you to the whole Komodo community and ecosystem. Specials thanks to jl777, blakjok3r, Alright and ca333.

## Ongoing:
- [Add AtomicDEX support into yiimp](https://github.com/tpruvot/yiimp/compare/next...phm87:AtomicDEX): Orderbooks, manual trading, get prices ... The support of AtomicDEX will add all mm2/AtomixDEX coins into the database of each yiimp pool that merges this future PR. ca333 was very kind and he gave me some RICK and MORTY, I'm planning to let anonymous visitors use the yiimp interface to perform RICK/MORTY trades.
- Add dpowlistunspent and cleanwallettransactions to each 3P coin (Hush, VRSC, EMC2, GAME, Chips, Bitcoin), no PR yet because some issues still remain.
