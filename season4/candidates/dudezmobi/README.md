since 2018

only 3 members during which I Established standards process in administering and maintaining 
the Staking pool infrastructure and the sustainability of all the related operations,Finaly 
decide to expand it to a public staking pool in last July 2019 with features such as HW 
firewall, server redundancy and a crappy_minimal but reliable discord bot all powred by Sun
