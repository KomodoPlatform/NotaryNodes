## Candidate info

I'm the CTO of [Magnum Wallet](https://magnumwallet.co).

I worked hard to support hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) and claiming rewards for Komodo with no additional fees.

I'm joining Notary Node election to increase node operators divercity and to add my impact to Komodo Ecosystem, by running
reliable and efficient Notary Node.

## Hardware

I have my own hardware dedicated to NN server, with UPS backup power and 1Gbit connection.
