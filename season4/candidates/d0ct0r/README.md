Dear KMD Community,

I hope you are all doing well. I'm here because I'm still a true KMD believer and with enough NN votes I'll earn the chance to prove it once more! I've learned a lot in my first season as a KMD NN operator. I've also enjoyed giving back to the KMD Discord community as committed with trivia, puzzles and games. Still more Discord events to come before the current season ends too!

In addition to still being a massive KMD enthusiast, I'm a well experience and self sufficient systems / networking administrator and project planner / manager as well as continued service directing / responding agent. I graduated college over 13 years ago and I've been operating as an independent IT contractor ever since. I've spent this time specializing in medical imaging IT sales, planning, coordinating, installing, configuring, calibrating, networking, securing, testing, servicing, and troubleshooting HIPPA compliant systems. I've never had a boss, just a handful of regular, trusting, and happy clients spanning the US.

The blockchain / crypto space continues to bring new depth and passion to my already obsessive IT life. I'm invigorated, interested and excited to greet my professional life every morning, every day. Thank you crypto space, and most especially thanks to KMD and it's core developers! Still the most promising, comprehensive and de facto blockchain project I've ever seen. It's a fact!

Custom rig building / GPU mining has been extremely fun. The experience has been beyond informative. Eye opening, highly thought provoking, and surprisingly, a bit character building. I crafted a few systems in summer of 2017 with ~ 20 high-end GPU's which I have successfully managed, maintained, upgraded as well as continually improving upon ever since. Through persistence I've achieved consistently exceptional / competitive hashrate, excellent uptime, power efficiency, and even effective heat utilization. All of this while constantly reassessing my idea of value, growing more aware of real-time trade-offs and opportunity costs.

Even after the extensive crypto bear market this is still where I want to be. Being a KMD NN operator is still an amazing opportunity I'd be honored to to earn for a second season!

I'm ready and very willing to make myself a continued part of the KMD network / community efforts. I eagerly joined the KMD Discord channel within only days of it coming online. If elected for another NN season I can be counted upon to remain present and involved with the Komodo community throughout my notary node upkeep and beyond. I'll work hard to keep my single node up and running at it's best in hopes of earning yet another season of service!

I'm prepared to run 1 North American KMD Notary Node to the best of my ability while also assisting community members where and when possible across a full range of potential matters which I might contribute advice towards drawn from years of real world experience.
