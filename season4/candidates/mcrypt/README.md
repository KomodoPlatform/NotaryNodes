Hello and Thank you for reading my Page

My Name is MCrypt and I have been around in the $Komodo community for a while now.
I'm not very active as a discord poster but you can verify that i have history.

I present myself as a candidate for the *SH region*. Voting address

**RS9JeJJQq6QRyNvQtRnsnBWLASN6W92bVi**

I'm a very capable unix operator as this is part of my day job. In my free time also run Komodo and ARRR nodes.

Using the mined funds I will pay for developments and bounties like for pbca26, lukechilds blackjoker if he comes back and others like dexstats and pirate.

I do not need this node as an income and I will donate as much as i can in the current market. This is my offer to support this economic crypto system.
