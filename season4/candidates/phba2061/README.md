## :information_source: My profile and background :information_source:

You can find my full background & profile on linkedin [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bao-an-pham-ho-b04814a3/). In short, I'm an electrical engineer who is currently working in France. After 3 years working for CEA as a R&D engineer, I decided to learn how to become a blockchain developper (fyi, CEA is a French public government-funded research organisation; me and my team, we build handheld gas sampling/analyzing devices, I wish I could show you some pictures but I can't due to NDA).

I'm also a "electronic geek", in the past I spent a lot of time playing with stuffs like Arduino board, Raspberry SBC, and electronic components such as microcontrollers, sensors, LCD screens ... Here's an example of what I would do during my free time. :clapper: [Rainbow RGB LED](https://youtu.be/YA9X3_JJ8hM) 

I'm also learning full-stack JavaScript during my free time (please take a look at my Komodo-Pokémon demo & Antara-coin-cap below).


## :question: Why should you vote for me :question:

I am operating a NN located in EU during season 3, at the moment of writing this proposal, my NN score is ranked #2 in EU, and #3 world, which you can check [here](https://komodostats.com/nn) (I think I'm a bit lucky though). So if you want to vote for a reliable NN operator, please consider voting for me.

I participated in testing CHIPS decentralized poker, setting up testing nodes for the CHIPS project. 

I'd like to focus on developping blockchain dapps. I've already deployed a few dapps on Ethereum Ropsten testnet. I'm also interrested in Komodo's crypto conditions (CC). During seaszon 3, I made a demo of non-fungible tokens (NFT) marketplace (that I call Komodo-Pokémon) built on Komodo MORTY chain (thanks to Komodo assets/tokens modules developped by dimxy & the rest of the team, & thanks gcharang & Mylo for the detailed documentation), which you find [here](https://github.com/NOCTLJRNE/Komodo-Pokemon/tree/dex). I also made a Antara-coin-cap web app, you can visit the app [here](http://antara-coin-cap.herokuapp.com/coinCap) (thanks Slyris for providing the back-end codes & thanks smk762 also TonyL for providing the back-end API !).  
 
I don't have the intention of giving rev shares to my voters, because: 1) I think it is a bad practice 2) I think it only economically gives voters a relative small percentage of what they already have (to secure a NN seat I will need at least 500000 votes, by becoming a NN I can mine up to 18500 KMD per year on average, let's say if I give 10000 KMD back to my voters, that's only 2% of their holdings !).

To summarize, rewards from my NN will be prioritized for: 
- covering NN server cost. 
- developing & promoting CC based dapps. (and I believe this will contribute to drive the value of KMD up in the long term).
