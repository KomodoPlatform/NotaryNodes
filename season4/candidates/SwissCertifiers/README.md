Motivation
----------

We are the SwissCertifier team, one experienced Web developer, and one Ph.D. in
computer science, with a proposed node fiber-connected in Switzerland.


Contributions
-------------

In addition to taking great care of the node performance, availability, and
security, we plan to continue educating people with regards to Komodo in
Switzerland. For example, we have been involved in the blockchain certificate
of advanced studies at the University of Geneva as well as Swiss computer
engineering schools, Swiss meetups, and conferences. We will also be a Swiss
relay for potential decentralized finance (DeFi) related to Komodo from DEX to
stablecoins because we are ourselves involved in this field. From a code point
of view, our contributions will be at the application and SDK level. There
might also be some innovative synergies at the applied research level.

Following is an example of a reference to Komodo DEX in our latest co-authored
chapter called "A Survey of KYC/AML for Cryptocurrencies Transactions" as part
the "Handbook of Research on Cyber Crime and Information Privacy” (to be
published soon)

Other examples are Binance DEX or Komodo DEX (Komodo—An Open, Composable Smart
Chain Platform, n.d.), which is even working as a smartphone application
(Decentralized Exchanges, 2019)
