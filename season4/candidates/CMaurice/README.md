Voting address: RLLvC9R3gEoj76LFuj7cBtSeQf9f7HYm3h

Region: EU

Discord: CMaurice#1685

### In short:

Hello. I'm a married fifty-something guy, living on a shoestring in an expensive part of the world. I read a lot online, eat well, exercise, and enjoy using cameras and bicycles. As a committed user of Komodo software both as a KMDLabs NN and otherwise, I will be helping secure, develop and test Komodoverse networks for the forseeable future, and hopefully as a Komodo NN. Please send your votes to the above address.

### More about me:

My background was in economics, finance and banking. My overriding lifelong interest is in money. You will not find anyone who knows so much about it who has so little. Well, they say you shouldn't make a career out of your hobby, and certainly I didn't manage to do that.

I remember the oil shock of '73, and the Continental Illinois bailout of '84, from which this current state of affairs has evolved. I got to study these sorts of things several times over; BSc Econ. (Accounting and Finance) '88.

I took to Debian and open source software in general around 2002 or so, and worked on projects like Morphix which wrapped up Debian into LiveCDs with bells and whistles, and also around then became interested in decentralisation, watching someone implement the the original Chord paper in Python in a few days. jl777's work reminds me of that experience. Hanging out with some of the best coders since then, and not having any formal training, has meant that I haven't had the confidence to code, so I'm not a dev type person, though I can do UI stuffs if pushed, and have a MSc (User-Interface Design).

As a founding director of a small insurance broker in the UK, I might be able to get the required FSA permissions to deal in regulated tokens should the requirement arise.

Though quite a reticent guy online, in person you'll find me quite voluble, garrulous and charismatic; free free to hit me up on Discord for a meet should you come to London.

### Market beliefs:

Today, late March 2020, the financial system looks as fragile as it ever has, and the willful venality and stupidity of the powers that be continues in trying to prop up the status quo at the expense of the individuals outside it with loans galore. What's needed, and was needed last time, is a [modern jubilee to reduce the debt in the system](https://braveneweurope.com/steve-keen-a-modern-jubilee-as-a-cure-to-the-financial-ills-of-the-coronavirus).

I got into crypto in 2014 or so, seeing it as a modern version of [free banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_banking#Scotland) and it has been part of my reading since then. I first came across Komodo around 2017 or so, seeing posts by jl777 on Bitcointalk, but didn't really get an appreciation for what was going on in the project until I joined the Discord server in August 2018.

I've been a NN operator for KMDlabs for the last year, which, depsite the lack of development activity recently, after a frenetic start before I joined, holds as much promise for me as it ever did; more and better opportunities arise with each of jk777's enterprising developments even though much work would be needed.

My belief in the ability of crypto with synthetics to deliver the ability for people to protect and design their financial futures will keep in the game for life, I expect.

These are very early days, there is much to do and a long way to go. I'm here for the long haul whether or not I gain attain privilege of becoming a main net NN operator.
