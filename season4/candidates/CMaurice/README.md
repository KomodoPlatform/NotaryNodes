## CMaurice Proposal for Komodo Notary Node Election 2020

Voting address: RFkYwfiyXNgVdde6Q27g6EB4Pm4hcpVc3H

Region: EU

Discord: CMaurice#1685


### In short:

A married fifty-something guy, living on a shoestring in an expensive part of the world, wants to help maintain a programmatic modern currency which at least does not express any politics as exemplified by the coronavirus stimuli in the US and UK. As a committed user of Komodo software both as a KMDLabs NN and otherwise, I will be helping to secure, develop and test Komodoverse networks for the forseeable future, and hopefully as a Komodo NN. Please send your votes to the above address.


### More about me:

My background was in economics, finance and banking. My overriding lifelong interests are in money and software. As they say, you shouldn't make a career out of your hobby, so I have retained a genuine interest in both that can be followed in part from my [Github stars](https://github.com/stars/mediovia) and [Twitter likes](https://twitter.com/CMaurice/likes).

I remember the oil shock of '73, and the Continental Illinois bailout of '84, from which this current state of affairs has evolved. I got to study these sorts of things several times over; BSc Econ. (Accounting and Finance) '88.

I took to Debian and open source software in general around 2002 or so, and worked on projects like Morphix which wrapped up Debian into LiveCDs with bells and whistles, and also around then became interested in decentralisation, watching someone implement the the original Chord paper in Python in a few days. jl777's work reminds me of that experience. Hanging out with some of the best coders since then, and not having any formal training, has meant that I haven't had the confidence to code, so I'm not a dev type person, though I can usually do UI stuffs if pushed, and have a MSc (User-Interface Design).

Though quite reticent online, in person you'll find me quite voluble on my favourite subjects.

I am a founding director of a small insurance broking company.


### On Crypto

I got into crypto in 2014 or so, seeing it as a modern version of [free banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_banking#Scotland) and it has been part of my reading since then. I first came across Komodo around 2017 or so, seeing posts by jl777 on Bitcointalk, but didn't really get an appreciation for what was going on in the project until I joined the Discord server in August 2018.

I've been a NN operator for KMDlabs for the last year, which, depsite the lack of development activity recently, after a frenetic start before I joined, holds as much promise for me as it ever did; more and better opportunities arise with each of jk777's enterprising developments even though much work would be needed.

My belief in the ability of crypto with synthetics to deliver the ability for people to protect and design their financial futures will keep in the game for life, I expect.

These are very early days, there is much to do and a long way to go. I'm here for the long haul whether or not I gain attain privilege of becoming a main net NN operator.
