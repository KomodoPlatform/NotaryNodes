## Artem Pikulin NN proposal

I joined Komodo Platform dev team more than 2 years ago, my first contribution was ETH and ERC20 integration to MarketMaker 1.0 (BarterDEX backend).
After that I was offered to lead the MarketMaker full rewrite to Rust, which was successfully completed.
The project keeps evolving as [AtomicDEX-API](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API), it's the core part of all AtomicDEX GUIs.
In addition to my dev contributions I would like to support the ecosystem by running the Notary Node in Russia.

I plan to use mined KMD for following purposes:
* Additional funding of AtomicDEX bounties for stress tests participation and other contributions to project.
* Create an "education fund" for AtomicDEX developers willing to take certification or online courses.
* Support developers willing to build their projects using AtomicDEX-API.
