## ABOUT STROB

2019 was my first season as a NN, I learned a lot: big thanks to the community who helped me become 

:trophy::trophy::trophy:<a href="https://komodostats.com/nn">THE #1 NN operator in North America</a>:trophy::trophy::trophy:

Currently with approx 5000 score points before the 2nd place. So if you want to vote for the best, vote for me! I reached these results by investing a lot in hardware and by dedicating many hours everyday and nights 7/7 to my node. With these perfect results in my pocket I plan to expand my operations in 2020 with more nodes if the voters kindly allow it to me.

I'm a big supporter of Pirate Chain ARRR (with "first mate" and "translators" titles on Pirate Discord). I made the animated Pirate Discord logo, and some animated logos for ARRR Twitch and Pirate OS. I also helped translate the Pirate.black website. I also earned a guru title as a Komodo NN operator. I donated 7% of my NN profits to CHIPS in 2019-2020.

I am a professional CG artist doing `3D animations` and `visual effects` since more than `25 years`. I am also passionated about crypto since 2014 and last year I made a video and some images for one of my favorite project: `Pirate $ARRR`: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWLLgYkouqE">TOP 5 Reasons Why You Need PIRATE CHAIN ARRR Privacy.</a>

[![Pirate ARRR privacy video](https://www.strob.net/kmdNN2019/ARRRprivacy600.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWLLgYkouqE)

Based near Montreal, Quebec, CANADA, I work for commercials, video games, movies and web. I do everything from design to modeling to compositing, fluid sim, particles, water, fire, smoke, set supervision and 360 HDRI photos shoot. I started my career 24 years ago by working at many VFX studios big and small in Montreal for Holywood movies (Journey 3D, etc), AAA games and TV shows (Prince of Persia, Myst IV, etc). I also did all the 3D for a video called Iron Baby that has been seen near `100 millions` times all over the web as well as the visual effects for a TV show called Phylactere Cola that I co-created within an artists group.

StrobFX is my own VFX studio since almost 10 years. I currently do mostly visual effects work and 3D animation on commercials for Cadillac, Subway, Danone, Kellogg's, Nestlé, Nature Valley and many others.

I work with my own dedicated render farm counting more than `200 cores` (in 16 high end servers and workstation) that I manage myself. My pipeline is based on Blender/Cycles-Eevee, Houdini/Arnold, Zbrush & 3ds Max/VRay. I can also make 360 degrees HDRI and 3D scans of objects of all sizes.

## STROB For Notary Node Operator in 2020!!!
I have a passion for crypto since 2014 and I got really interested in `Pirate` and `Komodo` in 2018. I would like crypto to bring more :smiley:`freedom` and :sunglasses:`privacy` to the world and I love the Komodo ecosystem community's philosophy and usefulness toward that goal. I would be honored to continue to be part of such an adventure by adding more nodes to my operations.

In 2019 I showed my dedication by becoming the #1 top NN op in NA, I will show the same dedication in 2020.

I also want to continue helping projects like ARRR and CHIPS when I can (like I did in 2019-2020 by doing some animated logos for ARRR Twitch, Discord and Pirate OS and donations to CHIPS.)


<br>

## STROB SKILLS
I am an artist but with a strong technical background having most often worked on 3D/VFX involving fluid simulations (smoke, water, fire), particles and rigging. I know the basics of a few scritping languages in 3ds Max, Maya, Softimage (maxscript, melscript, VEX, VOP) and I manage all kinds of softwares and plugins on my Windows render farm writing bat files to install, update or remove softwares and plugins. I maintain many websites and host my own ftp server since 2003. I also do some mining. I went through the whole Komodo Notary Node installation guide as well as the standard security setup sucessfully. So I can guarantee I have the skills to run the node. I am also eager to learn more about blockchain, IT and network security. I worked in Windows for years but I am now converted to Linux and loving it!

<br>

## STROB PROPOSAL
In 2019 I became the top NA NN operator. I promise tu run all my nodes with the same commitment and fast updates in 2019.

I would also like to continue promoting the `Komodo ecosystem` by doing other videos or 3D illustrations to promote the Komodo ecosystem like the ones I did for Pirate $ARRR at a small fraction of the cost.

<br>

## STROB HARDWARE
I have my own hardware for my NA server so I don't even need to access it remotely (no open SSH port). I also have many of those servers in a rack as well as many others setup as workstations (total of 16) so there will always be a hardware backup available. For my EU, SH and AR eventual servers I would use data center rentals.
