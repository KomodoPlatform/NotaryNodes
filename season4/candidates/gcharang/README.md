## Who am I?

  I graduated with a B.Tech in Engineering Physics and love solving problems. When I find an interesting problem, I scour all the available information for possible solutions and rest till I either solve it or know that people with more time and smarts than me have tried and failed :D . I first learned about Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin specifically) in 2014, but didn't think much of it other than "Interesting tech!". Later, in 2018 I came across an article about the Mt. Gox hack and how Centralised Exchanges are security holes. Then I started reading about alternatives and came across Atomic Swaps and DEX's which obviously led me to Komodo. After discussing the Atomic Swap tech with the team and community for several days, I was convinced this was the real deal and left it at that. A few days later, I came across a discussion about the `51%` attack problem and there was Komodo once again, having solved it through `dPoW`. I was very fascinated and came back to the Komodo live chat server (Slack at that time) and started asking more questions and links to documentation. 

  While I was reading the documentation, I found that while the tech was cutting edge and most of it documented properly, it was scattered across Github wikis of multiple repositories and various websites. When I complained about this difficulty in access, I was offered the task of improving it :smiley: , which I gladly accepted and completed. I was offered the job to maintain and add to the documentation a few days later (around May 2018). 

  Since then, I was a part of the Komodo Team and helped in various ways including testing, documenting new tech, end user support, etc. While Documentation and Support remain my major tasks today, I also created various tools that make testing and introduction to Komodo easier. 

  Some of them are:

- a directory of scripts(based on decker's omni installer) to install an explorer for a single smart chain https://github.com/gcharang/komodo-install-explorer
- a patch for the default insight explorer (decker's) that displays dPoW status and an ecosystem info banner https://github.com/gcharang/explorer-notarized
- a directory of scripts to create and manage a new Smart Chain using a single node https://github.com/gcharang/create-smartchain (it can also install an explorer) 
- created two npm packages for accessing `komodod`'s RPC using browser and nodejs. https://github.com/gcharang/komodo-rpc-js , https://github.com/gcharang/node-komodo-rpc
- a bot that auto bans impersonators of people with roles in our Discord server; it also has some commands to ban mass joining bots
- a bridge between the newly launched Community Portal and our Discord server https://pipedream.com/@gcharang?tab=workflows
- a website to display notary testnet's stats:  https://gcharang.github.io/notary-testnet-stats-2020/ (Source repo: https://github.com/gcharang/notary-testnet-stats-2020)
- the script used to collect and save the notary testnet stats: https://github.com/gcharang/notary-stats
- a cross-platform GUI prototype for all use cases that need the Komodo daemon running in the background: https://github.com/gcharang/komodo-electron-gui-prototype (In early stages of dev)

I am also a KMDLabs Notary Node operator and participated in Documenting most of the Komodo tech like Smart Chain creation(various launch parameters), Antara modules, nSPV, dexp2p etc., 

## Why run for a Notary Node?

The Komodo Notary Network needs reliable operators who will constantly monitor their own node and the network. They also need to update and upgrade their nodes on a daily basis to keep it healthy. I believe I can be one such operator based on my proven track record of being there for the community during the last `1.5` years. 

Currently most of the technologies developed by Komodo are coming together to present a mature platform that can solve most of the problems faced by the blockchain/cryptocurrency space like scaling, trustless stable coins, independent and secure chains, dICO's etc., while central to all of these achievements is `dPoW`. I have gained experience in using most of the technologies developed by Komodo except for the enablers of `dPoW` i.e., Notary Nodes. Being a Notary Node will allow me to experience the piece of technology that glues the Komodo Ecosystem together first hand and allow me to better explain Komodo to new people.

## Pledges

I have many ideas to make introduction and usage of Komodo's technologies easier. Some Examples:

- fork the repo https://github.com/janoside/btc-rpc-explorer to create a GUI Fullnode explorer for Komodo to make it easier for people afraid of the Terminal to use new Antara modules before a full featured GUI can be developed (Live example: https://btc-explorer.com/rpc-terminal)
- create videos explaining the new Atomic-Swap protocol, the Pegs mechanism, design of the DTO, new exciting features enabled by dexp2p, etc.
- make the insight explorers able to display data related to Antara modules  

After the server costs are subtracted, from the remaining funds I will use at least

- `10%` to commission graphics and explainer videos for Komodo
- `20%` to pay bounties/donations to Devs/Projects that contribute to the Komodo Ecosystem

These funds will be used to make the aforementioned ideas and others like them a reality. I plan to allot more funds for the above mentioned allocations based on the fiat price of Komodo at the time.

## Server Specifications

- CPU:  Intel  Xeon E3-1245v5 - 4c/8t - 3.5GHz /3.9GHz
- RAM:  64GB DDR4
- SSD:  SoftRaid 2x450GB SSD NVMe

(Will have Main and 3rd party servers with **at least** the above specifications for mainnet when elected)
