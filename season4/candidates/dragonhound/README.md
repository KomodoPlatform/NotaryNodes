I'm a bloke with two dogs, and I've been part of the Komodo Community since early 2018, spending my spare hours learning, building and testing. Most of this work was self-directed until I was honored with a place within the team as a dApp dev, support agent and qa tech.

Before joining the community, I spent the last decade working with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), automating cartographic production,  running spatial analysis, managing spatial databases, and running ArcGIS/QGIS training courses. Before that I was a nightshift forklift jockey in cold storage.
I've been an afterhours coder since my old man introduced me to PERL as a youngster, and done a variety of "on the side" contracts over the years using a variety of languages. 

More recently, I've spent the last 7 Aussie summers serving as an "intel" officer during fire suppression incidents in Australia, creating fire spread prediction maps and tools like flir2qr, which delivers hot spot maps from aerial imagery onto the smartphones of on ground crews before the observation aircraft lands to refuel.

## SERVER HARDWARE ##
- CPU: Dual E5-2690v2
- RAM: 128GB
- Speed: 10GigE
- HDD: 2x1TB SSD
- Location: USA

## Why you running? ##
I want to help build things to create a decentralised future I'd like to live in, and empower like-minded and motivated community members to do the same.
Running a NN is the next step in learning more and being able to do more. 

## What's in it for the community? ##
Collaboration and content. I have more ideas than time, and know there is talent within the community worth rewarding. If you have the time and talent to help, I'd like to tip you with tokens so we can build something awesome.

NN income (after server costs) will be split as follows:
- 7% Canine charity dontations to local shelter.
- 7% GPS/IoT development (both that which I am doing, and toward bounties or approved community projects).
- 7% KMD LABS training & development initiatives.
- 7% Komodo Pioneers initiatives.

Voters will also be offered unsolicited dog pics on request, and if you run out of toilet paper I'll spare you a square.
