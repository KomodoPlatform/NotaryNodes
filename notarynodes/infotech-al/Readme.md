## What will you do for Komodo the coin, Komodo platform?

My experience is in distributed systems, grid services, QA, Windows / Linux
servers. I cannot link my professional profile because it would be against company
policy. However, I assure you I am dedicated to KMD success as a platform and the
team behind it. I am confident I will meet the leads and devs at some point in my
journey here. I have setup a Notary sever already, I have signed up for a dedicated wifi
setup so I can monitor, maintain and access the Node for any issues day and night.

Additionally, I have changed all my online presence to market Komodo and grow
the platform organically.

## What will you offer back?
