# Cakeshop
Vote for [cakeshop projects](https://cakeshop.dev) in the NA & AR regions to make the funds do work.  A small developer team in the ME/SEA region, community testers and other community bounties including writing projects.

**Send your VOTE for a server to be run in the NA region**: `RUTn853UxzQ3kg3NJR67yGFGeRzoxGT8Kr`

**Send your VOTE for a server to be run in the AR region**: `RQSXenqmWT9HhfvaPiiKqFzFBuKyxzS9UL`

**The goals of cakeshop projects are to create base products for use in the ecosystem & collaborate**


# Financials
After server costs are taken out (budget at $500USD/month), the remaining KMD will be split like this
* 5% to go to LABS for their funding bounties
* 5% to go to KomodoPioneers for writing resources to be paid for their [DEX news site](https://hybriddex.com) & upcoming [multi-chain news site](http://test.shardwatch.com/multi-chain-projects).
* 80% to cakeshop projects below and the bounties for community involvement to test

# Proposal
Cakeshop has several projects already started, and will continue - although it will be at a snails pace without revenue, being part of the notary network will enable mined funds to be spent to grow (dev/human/testing/contractor)resources to these projects.

Cakeshop tries to take [existing implementations, the cakeshop](https://www.komodo-cakeshop.com/shop/) for showcase, and will continue to do so as the ecosystem grows.

An :point_right:[install guide](https://www.komodo-cakeshop.com/guide/):point_left: is available for the komodo-in-a-box and an amazon machine image (AMI) is available using :point_right:ami-03bc6b5a144a93d19:point_left: from your AWS Management Console.   Running the installer from scratch on any ubuntu-18.04 machine needs a little more :heart: but should work.

In-a-Box projects will require community testers and feedback, and funds for these items will be available in the form of community bounties.

* [komodo-in-a-box](https://cakeshop.dev/komodo-in-a-box/) is an easy installer for anyone to use.   It's aim is for any komodo project to be able to offer their community a standalone installer.  It currently only supports KMDICE, however - adding any existing assetchain is only minimal work.
* [komodo-in-a-box](https://cakeshop.dev/komodo-in-a-box/) can be easily made to sync with seed nodes that come from other projects, once given the startup parameters.
* [iguana-in-a-box](https://cakeshop.dev/iguana-in-a-box/) is a *proposed* installer for iguana for the purpose of the [streaming project](https://komodoplatform.com/tech-tuesday-update-6/).  Another simple installer for [projects that want to adopt the technology](https://komodoplatform.com/tt2019-12-custom-blockchain-game-dev-tools/) when it begins development & testing again.
* [marketmaker-in-a-box](https://cakeshop.dev/marketmaker-in-a-box/) is a *proposed* easy installer that can be used with the komodo ecosystem, and perhaps extended to use other blockchains, thereby creating bitcoin-in-a-box or XXXX-in-a-box.

## The ambitious endevours
* [Game development](https://cakeshop.dev/gamedev/) - a proof of concept hyper-casual game has been started by Ahmed that will be looking to integrate komodo's #cc-games development to use tokenization
* [Game development](https://cakeshop.dev/gamedev/) - exploring html5 frameworks like phaser for simpler games to integrate with a common blockchain backend that is being built within the community.
* [Game development](https://cakeshop.dev/gamedev/) - a simple lemondate stand style game using Komodo's CC tech to create modules for a cakeshop based game
* [Labs & Liqudity](https://cakeshop.dev/labs-liquidity/) - a small proof of concept 0x relayer is being built by Ahmed to explore the potential of integrating with the marketmaker network
* [Labs & Liqudity](https://cakeshop.dev/labs-liquidity/) - minor involvement in the interledger community can become more consistent.  ILPv4 has a rust implementation 
* [Android rom](https://www.komodo-cakeshop.com/android-rom/) for the komodo ecosystem projets to build upon.  When Oreo (8.0) was released, a major architectural change in Android occured which enabled a common system image to be used across multiple devices.  This will be useful for jumpstarting projects that can build on android.
* Cloud enablement using tools like terraform for cross cloud deployment and testing and introducing Komodo to organizations for blockchain integrations by becoming a [System Integrator Partner](https://www.hashicorp.com/partners).

# Why cakeshop exists
Cakeshop spawned itself from the komodo pioneers because that organization aims to be a DAO that provides supporting materials to independent people to hold meetups and other community initiatives.
