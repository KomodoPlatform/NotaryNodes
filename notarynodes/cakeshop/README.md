# Financials
After server costs are taken out (budget at $500USD/month), the remaining KMD will be split like this
* 10% to go to LABS for their funding bounties
* 10% to go to KomodoPioneers for writing resources to be paid for their [DEX news site](https://hybriddex.com) & upcoming [multi-chain news site](http://test.shardwatch.com/multi-chain-projects).
* 50% to cakeshop projects below and the bounties for community involvement to test

# Proposal
Cakeshop has several projects already started, and will continue - although it will be at a snails pace without revenue, being part of the notary network will enable mined funds to be spent to grow (dev/human/testing/contractor)resources to these projects.

![CAKESHOP 2019 PROPOSAL POSTER](https://i.imgur.com/pGG8K8e_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium)

Cakeshop tries to take [existing implementations, the cakeshop](https://www.komodo-cakeshop.com/shop/) for showcase, and will continue to do so as [the developer ecosystem grows](https://www.komodo-cakeshop.com/2019/02/24/disclaimer-using-komodo-cakeshop/).

An :point_right:[install guide](https://www.komodo-cakeshop.com/guide/):point_left: is available for the komodo-in-a-box and an amazon machine image (AMI) is available using :point_right:komodo-in-a-box or komodo from AMI search:point_left: from your AWS Management Console.   Running the installer from scratch on any ubuntu-18.04 machine needs a little more :heart: but should work.


In-a-Box projects will require community testers and feedback, and funds for these items will be available in the form of community bounties.

* [komodo-in-a-box](https://cakeshop.dev/komodo-in-a-box/) is an easy installer for anyone to use.   It's aim is for any komodo project to be able to offer their community a standalone installer.  It currently only supports KMDICE, however - adding any existing assetchain is only minimal work.
* [komodo-in-a-box](https://cakeshop.dev/komodo-in-a-box/) can be easily made to sync with seed nodes that come from other projects, once given the startup parameters.
* [iguana-in-a-box](https://cakeshop.dev/iguana-in-a-box/) is a *proposed* installer for iguana for the purpose of the [streaming project](https://komodoplatform.com/tech-tuesday-update-6/).  Another simple installer for [projects that want to adopt the technology](https://komodoplatform.com/tt2019-12-custom-blockchain-game-dev-tools/) when it begins development & testing again.
* [marketmaker-in-a-box](https://cakeshop.dev/marketmaker-in-a-box/) is a *proposed* easy installer that can be used with the komodo ecosystem, and perhaps extended to use other blockchains, thereby creating bitcoin-in-a-box or XXXX-in-a-box.
* [Game development](https://cakeshop.dev/gamedev/) - a proof of concept hyper-casual game has been started by Ahmed using Unity3d that will be looking to integrate komodo's #cc-games development to use tokenization
* [Game development](https://cakeshop.dev/gamedev/) - a simple lemonade stand style game using Komodo's CC tech to create modules for a "cakeshop" game
* [Labs & Liqudity](https://cakeshop.dev/labs-liquidity/) - a small proof of concept 0x relayer is being built by Ahmed to explore the potential of integrating with the marketmaker network
* Cloud enablement using tools like terraform for cross cloud deployment and testing and introducing Komodo to organizations for blockchain integrations by becoming a [System Integrator Partner](https://www.hashicorp.com/partners).

# Komodo-In-a-Box
For testing some of the latest stuff with Komodo only, I have made a video & install gist [komodo-in-a-box specific console](https://gist.github.com/imylomylo/d78d1b9fe6fd72ccf60f34329b56922f)

## Difference between KIaB & CIaB
* Original vision is for a turnkey multi blockchain installer leading to easy integration of marketmaker for supported coin communities
* CHIPS project easy installer as part of Cakeshop-In-a-Box will allow for secure SSH tunnel GUI play using a web proxy on the box
* Komodo-In-a-Box is a sub-section of the CIaB project specifically aimed at using the latest jl777 features like DTO (decentralized trustless oracles) Prices to make it accessible to more devs to create new crypto fintech integrations.  The KIaB is much quicker to release new features because it does not aim to manage firewall or user settings, purely for Komodo dev features, to ease installation/management.

# Why cakeshop exists
Cakeshop spawned itself from the komodo pioneers because that organization aims to be a DAO that provides supporting materials to independent people to hold meetups and other community initiatives.  As a DAO it is better to have no products or services that can create a liability on its constituents - and cakeshop was born.
