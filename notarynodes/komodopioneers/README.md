## Disclosure

- Some of our team are Komodo Platform team members (mylo, audo, diesmaster).
- We have pledged a portion of our mining rewards towards Komodo eco-system growth thru subsidizing meetups and producing presentations & content for sharing
- Approx 90%+ of mined KMD are still available because the pledge was to spend when above a minimum price, despite the bear market pioneers have been active as new trading demos with MM tech and game dev become public/stable.
