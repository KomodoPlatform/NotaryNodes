We are a candidate for the EU region.
[Our performance in the community meetup space is in our report](http://bit.ly/KPNN2019). Please take the time to flick through it to see how we represent Komodo.

We have also started a [DEX news site](https://hybriddex.com) with contributions from our newest team member who is a junior game dev.  The goal of this site is to cross communities and bring all crypto traders relevant DEX news.  The meetups and DEX news updates as well as collaboration within the community is what makes a pioneers vote bring more value to KMD.
