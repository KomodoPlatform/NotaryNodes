## EU Region Candidate 2019
We are a candidate for the EU region.

We have been actively organizing and supporting community meetups. You can [read more about that from our annual report](http://bit.ly/KPNN2019). Take your time to flick through it and see how we have represented Komodo and what we are up to.

We have also started a [DEX news site](https://hybriddex.com) with contributions from our newest team member who is a junior game dev.  The goal of this site is to cross communities and bring all crypto traders relevant DEX news.  The meetups and DEX news updates, as well as collaboration within the community, are what makes a pioneers vote bring more value to KMD.

## We Reinvest Back Into Komodo Ecosystem

We pledge up to 50 % of our notary node revenue towards activities that support Komodo ecosystems, such as events and meetups. We can also support other small scale initiatives, such as development projects. The pledged percentage is smaller if the KMD price is below four dollars. That is to ensure sufficient funding to maintain stable notarization service, which is our core responsibility.

The pledged funding is calculated monthly. On the calculation, we use the lowest price of the last day of each month. The price is taken from coinmarketcap.com. See the table below for example situations.
