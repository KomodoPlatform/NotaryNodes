In this proposal I talk about myself a lot.  That just seems to be the clearest way to express what I am offering.  Please don't think I'm a narcissistic megalomaniac.
I am in fact far, far better than that.  
:wink: :wink:

# Proposal

### Region: EU

### Purpose

As a Komodo EU Notary I will focus on notarizing.  Notarizing to the highest level I am able.  I will also support others in doing the same.  I believe that what we are creating here with Komodo is a very important step in the right direction.  As such, I take the responsibility of the role of Notary Node operator very seriously.
  
### Method

I will reliably put in the time and effort to do the best job I can possibly do.  This means being available when needed for updates, support and for active participation in the notary node community.  It also means I will do my best to improve my skills and hardware continually throughout the entire one year term.  Although these concepts may sound trivial and common, they are in fact not.  I believe my record, found through search or by asking around, will show that I am capable and willing to make this happen.

### Means
Through the use of a network of support I have developed and with the experience, skills and knowledge I have gained through working in KMDLabs as a Notary Node operator and basic tester I will continually optimize my node throughout the year, regardless of my notarization standings. I am not a dev or a very technical person but I have found out where and how to find and implement solutions to technical problems.

### Biography

The below accomplishments are very minor, without a doubt.  If you consider a start with absolute zero skill or knowledge of anything to do with computers, let alone blockchain and crypto, these accomplishments may take on a different perspective.

- mm1 stress test - received bug bounty for finding and reporting bug
- scaling test - one of very few to send a txBlast, participating where possible
- Pos64tests - actively participated in tests. Found minor bugs.  Only one to set up CC (dice) outside of 'official' test contract. 
- minor participation in PIRATE
  * setup a test chain for PIRATE NN tests (not used)
  * involved in deciding change to the current block reward
  * involved in PIRATE notarization testing in KMDLabs
- provide assistance in Discord ```'LANGUAGES AND LOCATIONS' #japanese``` channel
- KMDLabs
  * active participation in community
  * basic testing on setup of Labs
  * basic testing on first CCs
  * built and maintain [KMDLabs website](https://kmdlabs.com)
  * wrote, compiled or edited majority of content for website
  * setup and maintain [KMDLabs pad](https://kmdlabs.cc)
  * perform various non-dev jobs so devs can get on with devving
  
- basic testing on Marmara chain
- assisted in early Marmara documentation work
- mm2 community tester
- active in various KMD channels
- actively working with KMD team, outside of the online world, to bring business to KMD and its ecosystem

### Node
The exact details of the node I will be using will be finalized, should I be elected, after the election but well before going live on mainnet.  I expect an influx of new assetchains and and projects requiring dPoW over the coming year and will spec the server to meet this demand.  

Minimum specifications will be as follows:

| Specs | Details |
| ------ | ------ |
| CPU | Xeon/i7 (or equivalent AMD) |
| RAM | 128GB DDR4 ECC |
| Storage| 2 x 1TB SSD purpose|
| Network | 1 Gbps |
| Location | EU datacentre |

### Pledge

If elected as a KMD Notary Node operator I pledge to donate 20% of the KMD mined by the node to [KMDLabs](https://kmdlabs.com) to be used to improve their infrastructure and their support for development initiatives.   

> [KMDLabs](https://kmdlabs.com) is a 'not for profit' testing ground for R&D
>  work on Komodo (KMD), Komodo based assetchains
> and Crypto-Conditions contracts. It also provides an
> incentivized test network, technical services and support
> knowledge base that will attract and onboard projects
> and developers to the Komodo ecosystem. It is not a
> business, but aims to provide free and very low cost
> services for development on the Komodo Platform.

### The Point

The point of this embarrassing self-aggrandizement is to give you one simple picture.

**```I'll be there, I'll do the work and I'll push limits.```**

Please send votes my way.
