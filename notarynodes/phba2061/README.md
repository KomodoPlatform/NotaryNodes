## :information_source: My profile and background :information_source:

You can find my full background & profile on linkedin [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bao-an-pham-ho-b04814a3/) In short, I'm an electrical engineer who is currently working in France. After 3 years working for CEA (a French public government-funded research organisation), I decided to learn how to become a blockchain developper. 


## :question: Why should you vote for me :question:

I'd like to focus on developping blockchain dapps (I personnally believe that games will be the catalyst for blockchain mass adoption). I've already deployed a few dapps on Ethereum Ropsten testnet. I'm also interrested in Komodo's crypto conditions (CC), but didn't really have the time to take a deep look into it (I started with Ethereum because it is well documented and supported). By entrusting me your votes, I'll be able to fund my works with the mining rewards from notary node (NN), expand my team if needed (for the moment I'm the only member :grin:) and speed up my contribution to the Komodo ecosytem. 

I don't have much experience in system security/administration, but I don't mind spend time learning from other NN operators in order to guarantee the performance of my NN.

- A dapp (which was based on a Truffle framework tutorial, I migrated the front-end part to React) that I have deployed on Ethereum Ropsten testnet :dog: [codesandbox](https://jz0060zrmy.codesandbox.io/)
- A simple dice game smart-contract (which use blockhash instead of a true source of randomness), also deployed on Ropsten tesnet :game_die: [etherscan](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xb5a5734ba7198a2283730bc998f8af56408ca06d#code)
