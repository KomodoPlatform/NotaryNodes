# NN Season 8 Proposal for *`Dragonhound`* (smk)



## Who am I?
I've been part of the Komodo Community since early 2018, spending my spare hours learning, building, testing, writing docs and maintaining APIs.
Most of this work was self-directed until I was honored with a place within the team as a dApp dev, support agent and QA tech, which was a great role to absorb information about Komodo's technologies.
Most recently the main focus of my work has been:
- QA on the AtomicDEX apps
- Testing and documenting new AtomicDEX API features
- Writing / reviewing support guides
- Maintaining a variety of APIs, bots, block explorers and dashboards (e.g. [stats.kmd.io](http://stats.kmd.io)), [electrum-status.komodo.earth](https://electrum-status.komodo.earth), [defi-stats.komodo.earth](http://defi-stats.komodo.earth)
- Coordination of the Komodo Platform QA/DevOps Team

In my spare time, I work on things like the [PytomicDEX Makerbot](https://github.com/smk762/pytomicDEX_makerbot) or I blunt my tools trying to turn hardwoods into furniture.
I've been a Notary Node Operator for the last 5 seasons, and for the last 4 seasons have been responsible for distribution of notarisation funds to all the other Notary Nodes. Last season, I created a notary faucet using the Komodo Defi SDK, making it simple for Notary Node operators to top up their notary nodes as needed.

## Why Vote `Dragonhound`?
- Long term Komodo contributor and hodler. 
- Active Notary Notary operator since Season 3, contributing a variety of works to assist with smoother running.
- Always quick to update my Notary nodes when updates are announced, and offer advice to those who ask.
- Assist with testing out misc updates for dPoW, the Komodo daemon and AtomicDEX before release.
- Contributing code to the Komodo wallet (desktop), support via Discord, and guides via [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxZha6M0r90kFIGkFvKRvcw) & [https://developers.komodoplatform.com/](https://developers.komodoplatform.com/)
- Ongoing implementation of improved metrics and auditing of Notary Node related operations.
- Creating miscellaneous scripts, tools, bots and APIs to assist with Notary Node management/monitoring.
- Added Discord Faucet Bot to the KomodoPlatform Discord server, to assist with testing of AtomicDEX.
