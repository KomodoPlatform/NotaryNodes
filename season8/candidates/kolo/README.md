## Proposal

Hi! I'm Kolo and I want you to vote for me in the Notary Nodes ~~season 7~~ season 8 elections.

## Key reasons to vote for me:

- Created and supported infrastructure of Proof-of-Stake validators SaaS
- Countless years of experience. Started by season 0 in Komodo
- 4 years serving as a Notary Nodes network advisor
- Always best possible stats
- Large investment in hardware in AR (now both Asia and Middle East) and EU
- Uptime 99% during seasons 5 and 6
- Underground datacenter with protection from rocket attacks and air defence system (no jokes!)
- No cheating, background deals, closed agreements
- Never abandoned or refused any duty

Powerful and efficient dedicated hardware setups (Xeon hypervisors, NVMe drives, 10Gbit uplinks connected to local IX-es, Mikrotik networking equipment) in multiple very distant data centers.

## Dedication

I joined Komodo at a very early stage countless years ago. Since then I helped to create Komodo itself, the Notary Nodes network, a perfect community, and lots of fun. During testnet stage and the first 4 seasons, I served as a Notary Nodes network advisor and elections master. NN network will always have a very special place in my heart with all its wins 
and losses becoming personal. In fact, this proposals repo is created also by me.

Over 20 (whoosh, I want my 2003 back!) years in web dev/DevOps/networks. Starting from a personal webpage dedicated to my rat in 2002 and a homemade shared hosting provider to one of the world's largest payments accelerators.
