### smdmitry's Notary Node proposal ###

Currently I am operating Notary Nodes in the AR, EU, SH regions, they are all TOP3 performing nodes in their regions.
My goal is to maintain high performance nodes with timely updates and my priority is securing Komodo network.
I'm using top-notch servers located in several Datacentres and at home to provide diversity and reliability.

I'm the former CTO of Magnum Wallet. Worked on supporting hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) and claiming rewards for Komodo with no additional fees.

This season I'd like to win NA spot to cover all regions. I don't use community tools to manage my servers and operate independantly,
so my nodes will be free (as much as possible) from common bugs or misconfigurations, if any occur.
