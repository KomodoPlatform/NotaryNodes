## Introduction

As the Marmara Chain team and Marmara Community, we are proud of our contributions to the Komodo ecosystem thus far and are excited to embark on a new chapter in our journey. In this proposal, we will outline our unique position, bridging two continents - Europe and Asia - and our commitment to strengthening the Komodo ecosystem.

## Marmara Chain Notary Node Proposal 2024: Bridging Two Continents - Europe and Asia

We propose our candidacy as Notary Node (NN) on behalf of Marmara Chain Community. This year, we are planning to manage two Notary positions in **EU Region** and and **AR Region** as in the last year.
First, we would like to share a message from the founder of Marmara Chain.

>Dear Komodo community,
>
>This is Prof. Dr. B. Gültekin Çetiner, the founder of Marmara Chain, and I am writing to present our Notary Node proposal for the 2024 elections. **We are applying as a candidate for both the European Union (EU) and Asia Region (AR) notary nodes,** reflecting our unique position at the crossroads of two continents.
>
>Our team has successfully served as a notary node in the EU and AR regions, and we are eager to expand our contributions to the Komodo ecosystem. The Marmara region in Turkey is a unique location, connecting Asia and Europe with three physical bridges and the undersea Marmaray tunnel in Istanbul. We believe that our presence in both EU and AR regions will create a positive impact on the Komodo ecosystem and enhance the dPoW system by contributing from two different geographical locations that are very important for each other.
>
>**Achievements from Season 7**
>- **Successful Notary Node Operations:** Our team successfully operated notary nodes in both the EU and AR regions, contributing to the security and reliability of the Komodo notarization and spreading the Komodo vision among Marmara Community.
>- **Marmara Chain, MCL 4th Anniversary Event:** We celebrated our 4th anniversary with an event focusing on the real-world applications of blockchain. This included panel discussions specifically related to the Komodo ecosystem, such as **"Independent blockchain vision: Komodo way,"** highlighting the benefits of Komodo's approach.
>- **Blockchain in Real Life Event:** Hosted at Marmara University, this event explored the future potential of blockchain technology via the way Komodo vision. It included panel discussions, legal perspectives, and entrepreneurial insights, showcasing the practical utility of MCL and promoting blockchain adoption.
>- **Community Engagement:** We actively engaged with the community, fostering collaboration and raising awareness about the Komodo ecosystem in Turkey.
>
>**Why Our Candidacy Matters**
>The candidacy of the Marmara Chain team is not just about two nodes working as notaries; it represents the Marmara Community. This is crucial for spreading the Komodo vision, which empowers communities to create their own blockchains using Komodo technologies. Our team's involvement will significantly boost awareness and adoption, fostering a stronger, more interconnected Komodo ecosystem.
>
>By participating in both EU and AR notary nodes, we aim to create awareness about the Komodo notarization system in Turkey, where Marmara Chain was initiated. Our **Marmara Incubation System**, empowering innovation and growth within the community, and raising awareness about the **Komodo ecosystem in Turkey**, will be instrumental in achieving this goal.
>
>**As a team, we are dedicated to strengthening the Komodo ecosystem and fostering collaboration between diverse regions.** We believe that our **unique position, bridging Europe and Asia,** will help us achieve these goals, and we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.
>
>Thank you for considering our proposal, and **we look forward to continuing our journey with the Komodo community.**
>
>Sincerely,
>
>**Prof. Dr. B. Gültekin Çetiner**

# MORE ON KOMODO NOTARY NODE PROPOSAL

* As Marmara Team, we responded quickly to the update announcements in notarization system. We always kept our server up and running with the daily updates. 
* As Marmara Community, we have been trying to create awareness of Komodo Technologies at university and community level. It goes back to Barterdex days where we were conducting Atomic Swap tests at Marmara University. 
* Last year, we have participated in several TV program series on Local Television. At each program, we focused on Komodo Technologies while we are explaining Marmara Chain as one of the smart chains in Komodo ecosystem. 
* [Marmara Discord](https://marmara.io/discord) group has now more than 4000 members. We provide support with special channels for Komodo, Pirate, Tokel, Verus and other projects on ecosystem. The efforts continue to raise awareness at different regions in Turkey. Our position as being a notary node operator run by Marmara Chain officialy helps us promote the Komodo Notarization system and its Technologies in the region. 
* Our Marmara Team now has close relations with Komodo team members in cross-functional teams. 
* We currently run two offices one in the Technopark Istanbul near the Sabiha Gökçen International Airport and othe other office as being in the city centre located in the middle of two campuses of Marmara University. We have close relations with the University incubation center to meet the startup companies with the Komodo blockchain technologies.  
* We intend to spread end-to-end solutions of Komodo technologies to a very large audience and make Marmara Region a blockchain hub not only in Turkey but also in the neighboring regions.
* Our adventure with Komodo started more than 4 years ago. The history and more information may be found in (https://marmara.io/history) With the popularity, we intend to spread the use cases of Komodo in Turkey. 
* We present Komodo Technologies’ power by referring to complex problem solutions in Marmara Chain, i.e. MCL with custom consensus smart contracts that are executing centuries old complex credit functions. 

# WHY CANDIDACY FOR NOTARY NODE?
* The complexity and nature of Marmara Credit Loops requires our Marmara community get involved in many parts of end-to-end solutions in Komodo technologies. The notarization process will help understanding Komodo Technologies more and spread the word to all communities in Turkey and in the neighboring countries.
* The experience and reputation will help us to establish an educational center for developing Komodo way of Smart Contracts known as Crypto Conditions at Marmara University, other universities and technoparks. While we establish this center, notarization is one of the key services for showing the affiliation with Komodo. Therefore, we feel that our community should be involved in this technology so that we can provide benefits of dPoW to other projects in region.
* We strongly believe that Marmara community should and will be competent and strong to get involved in many potential projects in the near future by having talented people in Crypto Conditions, Smart Contracts by Komodo. 

### Being elected as notary nodes in Season 8 will strengthen our position to achieve those objectives and activities listed above. Therefore, we appreciate the support from the community in Komodo ecosystem.

# MARMARA CHAIN HISTORY
Marmara Credit Loops (MCL) is the fruit of the famous Komodo Platform and Marmara Open Innovations Lab (MINS LAB) at Marmara University based on a real use case running almost half of GDP both in Turkey and India as well as the neighboring countries to Turkey.

The story of Marmara Chain goes back to 2010 when seeking an interest-free and peer-to-peer alternative to credits in banking where banks create money out of thin air resulting in an unfair economical and social system. The three articles explain the major problems in banking systems [[1](https://www.academia.edu/9234489/DEBT_BASED_MONETARY_SYSTEM),[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521915001477),[3](https://www.michaeljournal.org/articles/social-credit/item/the-money-myth-exploded)]. A [town story](https://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2009/06/15/an-amusing-brainteaser) during TV series in 2013 triggered the already existing alternative happening for decades known as post-dated cheques and promissory notes in Turkey. Those post-dated checks work as analog blockchain in real-economy on a peer-to-peer credit creation basis without bearing any interest. We conducted several workshops by Open Innovation Labs at Marmara University to bring business people and academics together. Post-dated cheques and promissory notes as inspiration to project were analzyed to find out the problems with many case studies based on interviews. Then in 2016, we started the conceptual framework at Marmara University Open Innovation Laboratory. At the end of extensive research, we discovered that the project could only be realized by an independent chain with a mineable/stakeable coin supporting advanced way of smart contracts based on multilaw principles due to multi-cultural requirements in the system. During research the article titled as [Declaration of Independence](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1372879.0) by James Lee, `jl777c#5810`, the founder of Komodo platform attracted us towards the Komodo Platform where we discussed the complexities of the work with James Lee and how to solve the problems. We established a partnership to realize the project. Based on the first [academic paper](https://www.academia.edu/40504137/Marmara_Credit_Loops_A_Blockchain_Solution_to_Nonredemption_problem_in_Post_dated_Cheques) for MCL, the initial PoC was developed in 2019 by James Lee, the co-founder of Marmara and tests were carried out by hundreds of engineering students and some researchers. Many test chains were established to fine tune the system until the mainnet was started in 17th January, 2020.
