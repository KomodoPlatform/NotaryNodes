## Bio ##
I'm a Professor of Mathematics in one of the major Universities. My current research interests include key management, cryptographic applications and geopolitical aspects of cyber security.  A student of mine introduced Komodo technology to me.  I'm thrilled by the dPoW approach using the world's computing power to secure data with magnitudes less power.  I'm not an IT expert, but I know a thing about running servers.  Wanna try being a part of such an incredible idea.
