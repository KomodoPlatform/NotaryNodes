## About me

I am a Rust blockchain developer, I have extensive knowledge of blockchain technologies, particularly in the areas of Bitcoin and the Lightning Network.

I have been a member of the Komodo team since 2021, and I have been actively contributing to the development of the Komodo DeFi Framework. My work in the DeFi Framework includes the integration of the Lightning Network and adding support for SegWit. I have also worked on mm2 version stats collection for NN operators.

I believe my experience in blockchain development and my contributions to the Komodo project make me a qualified candidate for a Notary Node. This is also my second year running as I was elected as a Notary Node operator in Season 7.
