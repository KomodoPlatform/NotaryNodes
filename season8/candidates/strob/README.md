## STROB ACHIEVEMENTS

I am a professional CG artist doing `3D animations` and `visual effects` since more than `25 years`. I am also passionate about crypto since 2014 and Komodo holder since 2018.

At my first year as NN in 2019 I was able to rank #1 on the NA score board.

For my second year in 2020, I was #1 and #2 in NA.

For my third year in 2021, I was #1 and #2 in SH.

At my fouth year in 2022, I was #3 in SH.

I reached those scores by using the best hardware, solid maintenance schedule, monitoring 24/24, 7/7, 365/365, updating fast and having a plan B in case of problem: having quick turnaround solutions ready like redundant internet connections and DC accounts everywhere. I'm also always on Discord.

If having `dedicated`, `reliable`, `serious`, `honest` and `respectful` NN operators is a :heavy_plus_sign: for you, vote for me, you won't be disappointed.

In my previous seasons as a NN I donated time or KMD worth many thousands of $ to projects such as CHIPS and Pirate Chain ARRR and I will continue to support projects I deem important in the Komodo ecosystem.


### 3D ANIMATIONS

I created some 3D animations and assets for the Komodo ecosystem:
I did this animated logo for the Pirate ARRR that you can see on their Discord Channel. I also did some animated logos for ARRR Twitch and Pirate OS. I also helped translate the Pirate.black website.

I also created this `3 minutes` video for pirate ARRR, including idea, directing, 3D, voice over and sound.

### 3D PRINTABLE COINS

I created these coin 3D models for Komodo and Pirate Chain ARRR. The goal was to give some more visibility to Komodo and ecosystem on all the most important stock medias websites (Turbosquid, Sketchfab, Shutterstock, Pixabay and even the NFT marketplace OpenSea). I made these FREE for every media and anyone to use and it's also ready for 3D printing by anyone who wishes to.

### NFT

I also created this NFT collection on TOKEL to promote Komodo. Eye of the Komodo is a collection of 64 unique NFTs on Tokel blockchain. Each Komodo dragon eye represents one of the 64 servers securing over 30 production blockchains via delayed Proof of Work (dPoW), representing several hundred million dollars in value.

## STROB PROPOSAL
In many past seasons I was at the top in terms of node performance and I promise tu run all my nodes with the same commitment and fast updates for season 8.

<br>

## STROB HARDWARE
I use the best hardware for the task no matter the price. I am always ready with accounts in dozens of data centers in my nodes regions ready to go if needed. So I am always ready for a plan B if any problem happen I will have no downtime.

Example: Intel Xeon W-2145, 1TB NVME drive, 4x RAM 32768 MB DDR4 ECC reg (128GB total)
