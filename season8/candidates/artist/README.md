#### Why Vote for Me?

**1. AtomicDEX WordPress Plugin**

I developed a WordPress plugin that displays the live orderbook of AtomicDEX on any WordPress site with a simple shortcode. This plugin has been well-received by the community and has made it easier for WordPress site owners to integrate AtomicDEX functionalities into their platforms seamlessly with the use of a simple shortcode [order-book]

You can check out it's working capablity on the following URL (The Plugin is pending approval)

**2. Verus Coin Explorer Platform**

I have actively contributed to the development of the Verus Coin Explorer platform, which displays a list of basket currencies. The platform can be accessed at [Verus Coin Explorer](https://vce.vrsctest.net/). 

In collaboration with @Mylo, we are planning to launch a token launching platform on this site, which will further enhance its utility and provide new opportunities for the community.

**3. Writing about Komodo**

I have also written a lot of aricles on Komodo and Verus, Here are some of the publications:

**3. Future Development Plans**

I am continuously looking for ways to do what I can for Komodo and build what I can for the community to onboard newbies and techies unaware of what Komodo has to offer, to think outside the box and make KMD interact with tech in unconvential methods.

- **Improving the existing plugins**
  
- **Developing new plugins**

- **Finishing [MarketMaker/Komodefi](http://v3dev.komodefi.com:17077/dashboard) as Product for Komodo Community**

- **Completing Verus Currency Explorer once VerusID's are better in terms of development**

- **Write better content and create videos revolving around Komodo and platforms that collab with us**
