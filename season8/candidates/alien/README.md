## Who am I?
Blockchain enthusiast. Komodo lover, long-term hodler and a reliable Notary Node operator since Season 2. Been with the community since BTCD mining days. I run my Notary Nodes with high-end servers and no compromise on that. Also monitor the nodes and network all day, everyday. With experience on Komodo, iguana and Linux systems, along with operating my nodes, I try to help other operators who needs help. I help the Komodo ecosystem by testing new tech and reporting any issues found to make things better.

## Why Vote `alien`?
- Long term Komodo supporter and hodler.
- Top ranking Notary Notary operator since Season 2 to Season 5 in respective regions. You can check the stats [here](https://komodostats.com/nn).
- I put network security as priority before the server cost or anything else.
- I test all new core tech that Komodo develops and write the easy to follow testing guides for others. Some of my guides:

- Monitoring the network constantly with a dedicated computer and monitor 24/7.
- Helped VRSC notarization to continue with Season 2 keys for months until they hardforked to use Season 3 keys.
- One of the first to update my Notary nodes as updates becomes available.
- Testing out `komodod` and `iguana` to make sure they are working before they are being announced to update by other nodes.
