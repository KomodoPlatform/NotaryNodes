# naezith - NN Candidacy Proposal 2024 (Season 8)

## About me

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2Op0b8h.jpg" align="right">

I'm Tolga Ay, graduated from *Computer Engineering*, *Yildiz Technical University*. During my education, I solely developed and published my own video game *[Remnants of Naezith](https://store.steampowered.com/app/590590)* from scratch with C++ without using a game engine.

6 years ago, at Q4 2018, I joined Komodo as a *C++ & Fullstack Developer*. 

With the guidance of *[ca333](https://twitter.com/0xca333)*, I single-handedly developed my first project, *[Komodo's Antara Smart Chain Composer](https://youtu.be/QBDK2_2MsrE)*. 

Afterwards, being duo with *[Slyris](https://github.com/milerius)*, we made *[Antara Gaming SDK](https://youtu.be/k1vNYGzpHZ8)* and *[Komodo Wallet Desktop](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-wallet-desktop)*.

Then I released my second video game *[Dream Swing](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1860350)*.

These days I'm with the GUI team maintaining the *[Komodo Wallet](https://app.komodoplatform.com)*, and working on my *[third video game](https://twitter.com/naezith/status/1746456661915505119)* in the leisure time.
