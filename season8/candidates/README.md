# Notary Node elections 2024

See below for an overview of the currently active proposals for the 2024 Notary Node election.

To participate in the elections, submit your proposal by the 14th of June 2024 (23:59:59 UTC) into this repository using a folder with your operator name containing a `README.md` file. Check the other proposals and those from previous elections for an example.

Make sure to read the [Notary Node Election Bible](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dPoW/blob/dev/doc/bible.md) for more information about election rules and notary node duties.

Each proposal must include:
- The region(s) you are entering the elections to win. New candidates are limited to a single region, and incumbent notaries will be advised regarding additional eligibility based on previous season rankings.
- A voting address for each region you will be running for election in
- Your name and contact details (e.g. your discord username), and if running as part of a team or project, the name and contact details of other team members. 
- Specifications of servers you will be using if you win a spot.
- Two pubkeys which you will use to run your notary nodes in season 8. These must be securely generated and stored in a safe place!

Optional, but recommended:
- A short bio covering your skills/experience and any notable contributions you've made within the Komodo EcoSystem
- Details of any funding allocations to projects your node will support if elected.

Proposals missing the required info will not be merged until it is added, and may be rejected if not fixed prior to the deadline.

**DO NOT UPDATE THIS FILE DIRECTLY. The Komodo Platform team reviewers will update this table upon approval of your proposal.**
