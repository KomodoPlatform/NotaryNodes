### DIMXY

**Hello all**,

I am dimxy, a software engineer for more than 25 years. I am a komodo team member since November 2018. In Komodo I am a blockchain core-level developer and Komodo Wallet and DeFi API team member. 

For my time in Komodo I worked on custom consensus (aka cryptoconditions) blockchain applications like tokens and assets cc and nSPV protocol etc. Also, I am a contributor for the marmara project. During this project I did not only **Marmara** cc code development but also studied komodo PoS implementation and made many tests to study PoS algorithm and adapt it for the marmara specific requirements. We also successfully went through a couple of hardforks in marmara. Thankfully to the marmara project we found and fixed several issues in komodo cryptocondition framework.

Later I worked on the blockhain part for the **Tokel** project, extending tokens consensus code and nSPV code for tokel GUI applications. We moved to Cryptoconditions V2 (aka mixed mode) which provides more robust cc transaction validation and anti-spamming capabilities.

Also for a year I worked on the **komodo daemon codebase**, doing refactoring and adding performance improvements and tests and yet another year I spent on working on **komodo zebra project** (Rust-based daemon codebase adaptation).

Last year I worked in **Komodo Wallet API team** and contributed to this codebase developing sevices providing access to Komodo, BTC, ETH and other networks.

Before my work in crypto, I worked for many years for an IT company that was engaged in various state and enterprise IT projects. My job there was developing and deploying software applications, design system architectures and doing technology research for customers.

My motivation for participation in the komodo notarisation project is also a desire to help our great team to secure our network and be more involved in the codebase maintaining and provide more support for our solutions.

During the recent two seasons I have been a Notary Operator and was able to satisfy the notarisation process requirements and also managed to discover and fix several issues in the blockchain code. I'd like to continue to use my experience for improving this technology.

In total, I have C++ and Rust experience, with knowledge of blockchain code and technologes.<br>
