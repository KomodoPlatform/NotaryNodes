### Proposal for Decker: Candidate for Komodo Notary Node Season 8

#### Introduction
I am **Decker**, a candidate for the Komodo Platform Season 8 Notary Node program. With a robust background in the Komodo ecosystem, I bring a wealth of experience in developing, deploying, and maintaining Komodo software, as well as working on various blockchain-based projects. My technical expertise spans across C/C++ and Rust development, focusing on decentralized applications and blockchain security.

#### Experience and Contributions
Throughout my involvement with the Komodo Platform, I have made significant contributions to several key projects:
- **Komodod**: Worked extensively on the original [Komodo daemon](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo) implementation. I implemented all the upcoming changes, including [KIP0002](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/kips/blob/main/kips/kip-0002.mediawiki) and [KIP0003](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/kips/blob/main/kips/kip-0003.mediawiki), ensuring the system remains robust and up-to-date. I also continuously contribute to the daemon sources, including various refactorings such as optimizing library usage, following upstream changes from ZCash (e.g., [removing libsnark, libgmp, mini-gmp](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/pull/613)), and optimizing the build subsystem.
- **Zebra**: Contributed to Komodo's version of [Zebra](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/zebra), a second Komodo node implementation in Rust.
- **KomodoOcean**: Developed [KomodoOcean](https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean), a native GUI wallet for KMD and assetchains, providing a seamless user experience. This wallet is designed to support multiple assetchains and includes features such as advanced transaction options and robust security measures. KomodoOcean aims to be user-friendly while offering comprehensive functionalities to meet the needs of both novice and experienced users.
- **Komodo Explorers**: Created [explorers](https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo-explorers-install) for KMD coins and assetchains, improving transparency and accessibility.
- **Komodo Wallet**: Contributed to the development of [Komodo Wallet](https://komodoplatform.com/en/wallets.html), the former [AtomicDEX](https://atomicdex.io/en/), enhancing its functionality and security.

#### Professional Background
With over 20 years of experience as a security expert, developer, and system administrator, I am well-equipped to handle the demands of the Notary Node program. My roles within the Komodo Platform include serving as a *Core System Engineer* and *IT Expert*, where I am actively involved in internal events and developing and maintaining our software.

#### Notary Node Operation
As an operator of Notary Nodes in previous seasons, I have consistently delivered reliable and stable services. According to [current statistics](https://komodostats.com/nn), my existing Season 7 nodes are in the TOP 5 in the AR region, TOP 3 in the NA region, and number one among DEV nodes according to notarization score statistics. While these stats are relative and may not always reflect the full picture, they certainly demonstrate that my notary nodes are high-performing and stable. My track record speaks for itself, demonstrating my commitment to maintaining the highest standards of performance and security.

This year, I would like to expand my operations to all regions. Since I have one auto re-elected node in NA, I am going to apply for four spots: two spots in the AR region, one in the EU region, and one in the SH region.

#### Commitment to the Komodo Ecosystem
I am dedicated to using any rewards from the Notary Node program to further the development of the Komodo ecosystem. My ongoing contributions and active participation in the community underscore my commitment to the platform's growth and success.

#### Why Vote for Me?

I am a trustworthy and capable candidate for the Notary Node program, confident in my ability to provide the highest quality of service to the Komodo community.

Thank you for considering my candidacy for the Komodo Notary Node Season 8. Your support will enable me to continue contributing to the growth and success of the Komodo ecosystem.
