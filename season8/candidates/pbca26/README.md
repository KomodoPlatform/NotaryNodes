### [Komodo Hardware Wallet Tool](https://pbca26.github.io/hw-kmd-wallet)
Developed an all-in-one Komodo hardware wallet tool for claiming KMD rewards and managing Komodo smart chains. Ledger and Trezor owners can use it to receive and send funds. Also, I created a [standalone desktop app](https://github.com/pbca26/hw-kmd-wallet/releases) to improve stability and overall user experience.
