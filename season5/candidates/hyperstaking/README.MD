# Welcome to Hyperstaking NotaryNode 2021 Proposal

## Preface
We truly believe in the success of digital assets over fiat currencies. Bankless payment systems without middlemen and access to financial services must be granted to all the people over the globe and are literally around the corner. Komodo plays a key role during this endeavor. AtomixDEX in combination with crypto conditions is the killer application. The Komodo notarization system is the backbone to a higher level of security and trust within a permissionless distributed ledger.

## Introduction
We've been part of the Komodo community since the early days of BTCD and we participated in the NotaryNode 2018 and NotaryNode 2020 elections. Our team has an engineering and IT background and the proper motivation to do the job. We will strive for managing 2 notary nodes in the Asia-Russia and Southern Hemisphere region. All the more we are proud to participate in the notarizations part if getting elected.
