## :pushpin: The Tokel Project

Tokel is a KMD smartchain that enables the tokens, assets and oracless CC's. Anybody with 1 UTXO of TKL (the smartchain coin) can create a token (and even sell it immediately via the assetsCC enabled tokenDEX)
The project is creating an all-in-one, open source, GUI application that utilises nSPV (super-lite node application). This GUI will host a TKL coin wallet, multi-token wallet and exploring functions (for every token on Tokel), a tokenDEX for trading, an NFT marketplace and lastly, a token creation page, whereby anybody can create a token from their GUI.
