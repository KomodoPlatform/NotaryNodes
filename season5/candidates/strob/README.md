## STROB ACHIEVEMENTS

I am a professional CG artist doing `3D animations` and `visual effects` since more than `25 years`. I am also passionate about crypto since 2014 and Komodo holder since 2018.

At my first year as NN in 2019 I was able to rank #1 on the NA score board.

For my second year, I was #1 in SH and #2 in NA.

I reached those scores by using the best hardware, solid maintenance schedule, monitoring 24/24, 7/7, 365/365, updating fast and having a plan B in case of problem: having quick turnaround solutions ready like spare servers, spare parts, redundant internet connections, UPS and DC accounts everywhere. I'm also always on Discord.

If having `dedicated`, `reliable`, `serious`, `honest` and `respectful` NN operators is a :heavy_plus_sign: for you, vote for me, you won't be disappointed.

Donation:

In S3 (2019-2020) I gave 7% of my profits to CHIPS and 

In S4 (2020-2021) I made a donation of `2415.42 KMD` (worth 5,255$ USD or 6,609$ CAD at donation time) to CHIPS again.

In S5 I would like to make donations to projects like Tokel which would bring NFT to the Komodo ecosystem and as a 3D CG artist, that's something I'm really interested in.

I created some 3D animations and assets for the Komodo ecosystem:
I did this animated logo for the Pirate ARRR that you can see on their Discord Channel. I also did some animated logos for ARRR Twitch and Pirate OS. I also helped translate the Pirate.black website.

I also created this `3 minutes` video for pirate ARRR, including idea, directing, 3D, voice over and sound. Thanks to a ARRR supporter to contribute approx 1000$ to this project.

I created this 3D model of a Komodo Season 5 2021 Commemorative Coin. The goal was to give some more visibility to Komodo on all the most important stock medias websites (Turbosquid, Sketchfab, Shutterstock, Pixabay and even the NFT marketplace OpenSea). There were many BTC and ETH coins for sale but no KMD and I made this one FREE for every media and anyone to use and it's also ready for 3D printing by anyone who wishes to. I made it to act as a business card for Komodo with all the most important keywords about AtomicDex and dPoW that makes Komodo unique. I hope to create more coins like this for the whole Komodo ecosystem. When I sell a single stock model like this one on these marketplaces I can earn approx 10k$ &+ over my life if it sells good, I am making this one available for free to promote Komodo.

## STROB PROPOSAL
In 2019 I was the top NA NN operator. In 2020 I was the top in SH and second in NA. I promise tu run all my nodes with the same commitment and fast updates in 2021.

I would also like to continue promoting the `Komodo ecosystem` by doing other videos or 3D illustrations and 3D coin designs and, why not, NFTs.

<br>

## STROB HARDWARE
I use the best hardware for the task no matter the price. I have many servers ready in NA at home (with UPS and 2 different 1GBPS connections) and in many different data centers. In SH I have accounts in many different data centers too. So I am always ready for a plan B if any problem happen I will have almost no downtime.
