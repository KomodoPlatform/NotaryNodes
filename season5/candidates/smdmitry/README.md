## Candidate info

I'm the former CTO of [Magnum Wallet](https://magnumwallet.co).
I worked hard to support hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) and claiming rewards for Komodo with no additional fees.

Currently I am operating one Notary Node in the AR region smdmitry_AR, and it's in the TOP3 performing nodes.
My goal is to maintain high performance nodes with timely updates and my priority is securing Komodo network.

## Hardware

I'm using top-notch servers located in several Datacentres and at home to provide divercity and reliability.
