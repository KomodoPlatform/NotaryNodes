I'm candidate to be Notary Node operator during the 2021-2022 season in order to continue to notarize, move to a better server and provider, continue to develop my **current projects** and launch/support **new projects** !

Please review and comment the past and future projects listed here below.

## Who am I ?

I've been Notary Node operator of phm87_SH and Community Contributor since 2019, I contributed to iguana/dPoW, chips and Komodo ecosystem.

During the 2020-2021 season, my performances were lower than during the 2019-2020 season, I tested [PR 201](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dPoW/pull/201) during a too long time, I had a swap configuration issue and a hardware issue. If I am elected for the 2021-2022 season, I won't test any code change on my Notary Node (whatever it is agreed by community) except if KMD team asks to test the official dev branch. If I want to test any iguana/dPoW change, I'll ask a DEV NN operator to test my code.

Thank you to Komodo Team to have merged my pull requests to githubs of komodo and dPoW/iguana despite the additional workload. I am very happy to be part of Komodo community and Notary Nodes, I had many interesting open-minded discussions about KMD tech and other projects. Learning how consensus code works and different protocol is a long learning curve but I'm happy to do it with KMD community.

Big thank you to the whole Komodo community and ecosystem. Specials thanks to jl777, metaphilibert, Ludom, SHossain, blakjok3r, Alright and ca333.

# Server requirements:
Servers specifications will be fine tuned according to requirements for season 2021-2022:
- Intel Xeon E3-1245v5 - 4c/8t - 3.5 GHz/3.9 GHz
- 96GB or 128GB ECC
- NVMe 1.2 To RAID

I'm sick of my current 64GB server, if I am elected, I'll use a server with 96GB or 128GB RAM.

# Pledges for season 5
Having better stats by:
- migrating to a better datacenter and server
- automate more (at least send a warning if a problem happens, try to fix the problem if it can be fixed automatically)

Support Blur, TOKEL, CHIPS and open-food-chain projects with:
- allocation of 8% of KMD block rewards to Blur dPoW project
- allocation of 3% of KMD block rewards to TOKEL project
- allocation of 3% of KMD block rewards to CHIPS project
- allocation of 3% of KMD block rewards to open-food-chain project

If KMDUSD price falls below $0.5 the allocation will be calculated after servers costs deduced (main Notary Node server and Secondary 3P server) for the period when KMD is below $0.5. This rule will decrease risk of payment issues of mandatory servers if price crashes. During season 3, when price was low, Notary Node was not profitable with the huge direct donation.

## 2020-2021 Projects/milestones

### Integration of aPoW into CHIPS
- <span style="color:green">[SUCCESS]</span> **Integration of aPoW into CHIPS**: Final cleanup and testing of the code (thank you SHossain for the help with your ASIC), successfull network hard-fork ! This integration was supported by a bounty and I received personal donations but my Notary Node was helpful to test my new CHIPS code when notarizing on the Notary Node.

### -ac_aur : new parameter to enable active user rewards for smartchains !
- [DEV FINISHED] **-ac_aur=** this new parameter allows to have **active user rewards enabled for smartchains**: the code of Komodo's active user rewards is used, I added conditions to allow it for smartchains. I tested it locally then TAUR testchain was launched in KMDLabs. I will contact TonyL to ask help to run pytests of KMD to avoid regression then I'll pull request this change to komodo source.

### -ac_naur
- [DEV STOPPED] **-ac_naur=** this runtime parameter allows to have **negative active user rewards enabled for smartchains**: my code doesn't work and community demand for negative rates is low so I stopped this development until some demand exists.

## 2021-2022 Projects/ideas

Most of these projects are ongoing. The NN earnings will be helpful to support these projects.

**Please vote for me if you want to support these projects !**

### Cross-chain development
- I discussed on discord and slack how to **airdrop a smartchain/token to all hodlers of an ERC20 (or BEP20)** ? I'd like to do the experiment on 1MT token then later on other tokens. It is not possible to calculate the pubkey based on an ERC20/ethereum address that never sent funds nor signed a message. Using the message (or transaction) signed, we can derive the pubkey. Given current Ethereum fees, one solution discussed is to create a web3 webpage asking to sign a transaction (or message), don't broadcast it on Ethereum mainet network, then retrieve it offchain and verify the signature offchain. A CC adapted can be useful (or a CC "node" as discussed with Alright).

Why 1MT? 1MT use cases are similar to PANGEA's and CHIPS' ones (poker, gambling, online casinos). Team sizes are similar, but Chips Team is more orientated on tech side, while 1MT team is focused on marketing. 1MT is not searching to partner with CHIPS now (as no official discussion happened, projects' teams don't know each other). But if we give some tech support to 1MT (integration into AtomicDEX exchange, airdrop test using 1MT hodlers list, web3 tests on BSC using 1MT, faucet), maybe partnerships will be possible with CHIPS. Chips Team is doing a great job but the marketing skills of 1MT Team are above Chips Team. The discord presence of 1MT is important. But about tech, we can give support and help 1MT to get stronger. I think that at the end, both communities can become stronger united.

https://gist.github.com/phm87/e05912920dabbfb64f943b6a6a047d58

- Since the ``PancakeSwap: KMD-BUSD`` constract exists on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) but integration into PancakeSwap main staking contract requires a cost and it may benefit mostly CAKE in the long term, why not create a smartchain that has permissioned mining based on having an LP token on the BSC side ? It will allow to **farm KMD-BUSD** without integration into PancakeSwap main staking contract. As discussed with PTYX on discord, it would be a major task but not impossible.

A first implementation could rely on tweaked -ac_staked or -ac_easymining and use data of explorers'API. If community likes the concept, a stronger implementation that would require Notary Nodes to run the smartchain and a BSC node can be developed.

https://bscscan.com/address/0x24b9b6c7b3b2c1a9c1f783228edf7d241091384a

Remark: -ac_easymining is an ongoing developement of mine similar to -ac_aur to allow smartchains to be mined by a defined set of pubkeys, similar to Notary Nodes easy mining.

### AtomicDEX
- [TESTS ONGOING] I began to work on a multicurrency **discord faucet** using AtomicDEX-API in the back-end. The lightwallet features are used but not (yet) the DEX features. Public testing will begin soon.

The withdraw function of AtomicDEX-API is used in the current implementation but we can use batch transactions to send coins to faucet users to lower fees (sendmany equivalent), I began to work to adapt AtomicDEX-API to have a new rpc call similar to sendmany but I'm very new to rust.
This **discord faucet** can be a good introduction of AtomicDEX to coins'teams. The demand for disord faucets & tipbots is increasing due to the Bubble.

I'm afraid about hodling balances of individuals without a proper legal structure, I'll discuss with PTYX and community about creating a structure. Then, the discord faucet can be turned into a **discord faucet & tip bot**.

https://github.com/phm87/discord-faucet-adex

<img src="OUTLAWSYS_discord.png" alt="drawing" width="90%" height="90%" />

I'm also in good terms with "Wolves of Alt Street" discord server (3000 members, discord created 3 months ago) but no agreement yet about inviting the faucet. It can be invited to other friendly discord servers but ideally, the bot should be invited on discord server of each coin listed on AtomicDEX. The infrastructure to run the tip.cc bot (2000 000 users, bot present on 17 000 servers) is not cheap, NN earnings will help to have enough servers and redundancy.

<img src="TestBot1904.png" alt="drawing" width="90%" height="90%" />

I'll use some NN earnings to fund the faucet in KMD, VRSC and Tokel.

- **Add and test ERC20 (and BEP20) into AtomicDEX**: I'd like to add and test some ERC20 (and BEP20 when possible) on AtomicDEX-API: 1MT and WSCRT, two ERC20 so I won't need to run any electrumx since it relies on Ethereum (or Binance Smart Chain) blockchain. 

Why 1MT ? See explanations here below (cross-chain development).

Why SCRT and WSCRT ? WSCRT is SCRT wrapped on ethereum. I know IRL a SCRT Team member so we need to integrate more our ecosystems. SCRT allows to execute private smart contracts using special hardware and HSM, their system is very interesting technologically. Maybe it can be interesting to create a bridge between SCRT and ARRR. Will we see a future bARRR/bSCRT LP farm on pancakeswap in the future ? I won't describe all SCRT features in this proposal but I think that many bridges are possible between our communities.

https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/compare/master...phm87:patch-1

https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/compare/dev...phm87:patch-1

I will add cipi remarks (contract address must be in mixed case), thank you for the support.

- **Integration and support of coins into AtomicDEX**: When a coin is added on my mining pool, I'd like to run an electrumx for it then add it on AtomicDEX and on the discord faucet. we can't rely on KMD Team to run electrumx for many coins. This additional infrastructure will be paid with NN earnings.

Adding suport for SCRT will require more work since SCRT blockchain is a based on Cosmos (and Cosmos is not yet supported on AtomicDEX).

- About **integration of AtomicDEX into yiimp**, since most of the code is ready, I'm planning to perform more tests, document it properly, add helpers about how to use and configure. A pull request can be done when more testing will be done. Maybe I'll ask some help to crackers and Ondalf of zpool.

[Add AtomicDEX support into yiimp](https://github.com/tpruvot/yiimp/compare/next...phm87:AtomicDEX)

### CHIPS
- Support of chips in the discord faucet (using AtomicDEX-API in the back-end)
- I'd like to **enhance some rpc calls** about cpu mining (details to be discussed with chips team)
- Possible discussion with 1MT Team that may lead to mutual help, who knows. I had a dream of a poker game using Chips tech in the back-end and 1MT Discord GUI.

### Komodo enhancements/developments
- [PUBLIC TESTS ONGOING] **-ac_aur=** 
I'd like to execute regression tests (in python) then do a pull request to komodo repository.

- [TESTS ONGOING] New RPC call **validateaddressgeneric** to verify an address belonging to any coin. This rpc call is not specific to Komodo, it can be added into AtomicDEX-API but since the aim was to try to run it on the mining pool using yiimp architecture, a coin daemon is more suitable. As discussed with Alright, many other RPC calls unrelated to Komodo were added to Komodo. Maybe I'll pull request this RPC call into phm87 branch.

https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/compare/master...phm87:patch-23

### ARM platforms / HSM modules
My interest in ARM platforms and HSM modules is increasing. I discussed about adding Komodo to a plastic card HSM (Belgian company). During my tests, I ran AtomicDEX-API, bitcoin, LN node and komodo on a Raspberry Pi. I'd like to help and support webworker01 work on ARM platforms.

https://gist.github.com/phm87/cdee681423030898f05ba2544d84831e

In order to let coin communities run their own Notary/dPoW network but also possibility to run AtomicDEX-API + Desktop + local full nodes and minimize costs, I think that running dPoW 2.0 on Raspberry Pi can help for decentralization. The current dPoW 1.0 won't work properly on Raspberry Pi due to additional calculation delays. Some other Notary Node operators also had ideas about using Raspberry Pi.
