## Who am I & what I am capable of
First of all thank you for reading my proposal, I prefer to stay anonymous due to several reasons, through my entire career I have experiences & knowledge with multiple subjects & domain, including blockchain, cryptocurrencies & IT, that's why I think I could be suitable for the NN operator job & apply for the election this year. I have acquired AWS certificates for Assoiate Solution Architect, Developper & SysOps Administrator.

## Pledges & promises
- First & for most with my SysOps admin skillset, I guarantee to minimize any possible downtime of my servers & follow any update of the network.
- I will also dedicate my entire first month earning as a notary node operator to 2 projects of the Komodo ecosystem that seem most interresting to me: CHIPS & TOKEL. 

## Social contact
`hashira#8836` is my Discord handle & I'm open to any conversation !
