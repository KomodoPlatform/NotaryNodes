## Who am I?

Hello! I'm Kulim. I started to study in Bolu Abant İzzet Baysal University, Department of Construction Technology and also in the Department of Web Design and Coding. I graduated from Construction Technology. I attended workshops at the university, I got acquainted with @Paro and got an idea about MCL and Komodo. In this way, my interest in Blockchain started. 
	Afterwards, I received intensive training on blockchain, Komodo, Antara module, notary public, etc. from @Paro. What is a notary? How to establish a notary public? How is the notary public managed? How is a coin created? We had the opportunity to carefully examine and dwell on titles such as. After that, I practiced as a Notary in the 4th season of Komodo Notary under the supervision of @Paro. I managed the Marmarachain notary for eight months without any problems. 
	I believe that I can do Komodo Notary Office based on what I learned and experience and I want to be in Komodo Notary for the 5th season.

## Friendly notary.

 @ Paro#7842 ; ebesigüzel is my teammate with whom I have worked as a notary for 8 months.
