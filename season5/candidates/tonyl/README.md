My NN performance in past season beginning was not so good because I've tried to place servers at home. This season, if elected, I'll use dedicated servers from start.

If you individual or group of individuals with a fire burning in their eyes and idea to build project on Komodo tech: I can allocate a grant from NN earnings.
Note that with the current price this offer aimed at individuals mostly who need servers for playing and etc. 

For consultation/discussion/advice on apps/projects creation on Komodo tech topic feel free to contact me:
### KomodoPlatform Discord `TonyL#3577`
### Email: `alysakov at komodoplatform.com`

Thank you for reading that. Wish you a productive day/night! <3
