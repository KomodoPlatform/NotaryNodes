## Who am I?
Blockchain enthusiast. Komodo lover, long-term hodler and a reliable Notary Node operator since Season 2. Been with the community since BTCD mining days. I run my Notary Nodes with high-end servers and no compromise on that. Also monitor the nodes and network all day, everyday . With experience on Komodo, iguana and Linux systems, along with operating my nodes, I try to help other operators who needs help. I help the Komodo ecosystem by testing new tech and reporting any issues found to make things better.

## Why Vote `alien`?
- Long term Komodo supporter and hodler.

- Tested barterDEX and wrote the first full barterDEX API doc.
- Help out other Notary Operators as needed.
- Ported Insight Explorer for CHIPS blockchain [ChipsSight](https://github.com/techloverhd/chipssight/) and serving and instance [here](https://chipssight.techloverhd.com/).
- Monitoring the network constantly with a dedicated computer and monitor 24/7.
- Helped VRSC notarization to continue with Season 2 keys for months until they hardforked to use Season 3 keys.
- One of the first to update my Notary nodes as updates becomes available.
- Testing out `komodod` and `iguana` to make sure they are working before they are being announced to update by other nodes.
- Helping CHIPS chain with continuous mining.
- Helped the team and the community after the Agama hack, claiming and the refund process which is still continuing.

## Server Spec
```
alien server - a server with latest and greatest tech
```
_Currently I am operating one Notary Node in the AR region `alien_AR`, one Notary Node in the EU region `alien_EU` & one Notary Node in the NA region `alien_NA`. All of them are at the top position in their respective region by performance._

### Thank you very much for voting for me and trusting me with securing the Komodo Notary Node network.
