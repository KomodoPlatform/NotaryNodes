## The Ben Fairbank Project (BFP)

Ben Fairbank is a prominent identity in the crypto community, and a person of interest to the Komodo community.

If successful in VOTE21, the BFP will use 100% of NN net profits to fund an experimental art project based around the public life of Ben Fairbank.

We will hire an experienced operator to run a quality NN!!

We will use NN profits to purchase quality pictures & videos that capture Ben Fairbank in public places using standard paparatzi 'rules of engagement', we will only purchase legal content obtained using well established protocols in photo journalism.

The purchased images will be used to create NFT art works, 100% owned by the holders of a new airdropped governance token, "Ben Fairbank Token" (BFT).

BFT will be airdropped to SuperNET token holders, and the "Ben Fairbank Project" will operate as a DAO with all major decisions being voted on by BFT holders.

BFT holders may vote to monetize the collection through auctions, sales, and other collaberations with digital artists.

BFP's long term goal is to experiment with NFT art, explore the nature of "crypto celebrity" at the dawn of mainstream adoption, and (hopefully) over time create value from monetising a collection of Ben Fairbank inspired images, memes, and NFT artworks, to firstly make the project self sustaining, and secondly, to create value for the BFT holders to recover some of the SuperNET losses from the RedFox migration theft.

We understand that turning someones public life into a crypto version of "The Truman Show" to create NFT artworks for financial gain will not appeal to everyone, but in the case of Ben Fairbank & SuperNET, we feel it "might" be legitimate, and propose the idea at this time for the KMD community to vote on, and hopefully fund through NN profits.

1. Ben Fairbank is a public figure with years of experience in the crypto industry.

2. BFP will only purchase images & videos that are legally acquired, we will NOT condone any illegal activities.

3. All potential financial beneficiaries of this project suffered large losses from the RedFox situation.

4. BFP can create a significant artistic body of work in a new & exciting medium.
