He built our North America hosting facility and will be constructing our second Galt Mines facility in Southern Chile at Fort Galt, where he also serves as the IT advisor and subcontractor.

## Why Vote For Us

**A Competent Team**

We bring together a team of very competent people two of which have an extensive business background and who are more than capable of operating IT infrastructure, handling security and even brand awareness.  Juan through his evangelism and love for crypto brings brand awareness to the Komodo Platform. All of his videos carry his "Sponsored by Komodo" introduction which is his exclusive advertiser and sponsor. Juan regularly attends conferences and 5% of revenue from any newly elected notary nodes we get will go to support his travel and marketing expenses.

**Shenlong's Den**

One of the things we want to do for Komodo this year is creating a private fund for Komodo projects and services we like to call Shenlong’s Den.

The idea is simple. You have a project, you propose it to us and make an ask for funding, we analyze it and decide whether or not and how to deliver capital to your project.

The 3 of us at The Galt Mines make final decisions on funding, which I believe will help bring more accountability to blockchain funding of community services then has been seen in other projects like DASH or Pivx.

**Business Strategy and Legal Protections**

Last but not least we take very seriously the disruptive potential of Komodo, both as a way to bring zcash grade anonymity to other coins thru BarterDex, but also as a way to have them benefit from Bitcoin’s security while making their own core development decisions, as blockchains in their own right. This is the great innovation behind the notary system which from my 4+ years of experience in this market is very unique.

And of course atomic swap non-custodial exchange. What else needs to be said? Komodo has serious potential.

With that in mind we are looking to create a space to discuss legal defense strategies starting with the way North American institutions might look at Komodo, but also, ideally exploring how we stand in legal terms worldwide.

We believe it will be important to pay attention to this side of things in the coming years and starting this conversation now with the right people will allow us to be prepared and not surprised if legal attacks do come.

## Election Details and How To Vote For Us!

This year we would like to take on the responsibility of up to three more notary nodes. We have carefully selected what we think are some of the better locations for each one.  If we get a Southern Hemisphere node we intend to re-locate it to Chile when our datacenter is complete later in 2018.

Below are the locations and the addresses including a z-address for private voting. Send VOTE2018 tokens to the addresses shown below. Thank you for your support, we look forward to help build the Komodo Platform.
