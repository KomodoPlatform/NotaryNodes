**Hello, thank you for reading my application!**

Every month I will donate 50% of the mined KMD to a good cause (Topic: Children (Anti-Child-Abuse programs; Education)).  

I will propose at least 3 different projects every month and let the Komodo-Community vote on how many % each project should get.
  
I won 3 slots in the last elections and did keep them up & stable since then. 

----------

Notary Node Operators have to be **reliable**, **trustworthy** and **tech-savy!**

I am

-   **Trustworthy** (Community-Member since Day 1 (SuperNET), **1 of 3 ICO-Wallet-Key holders**, managing various Komodo Platform domains, Slack workspace founder, managing Komodo wages payout, â€¦)
    
-   **Reliable** (Online every day, thus able to update whenever necessary!)
    
-   **Tech-Savy** (My nodes are secure - I use ssh-keys to access them & run only software that is really necessary. I do regular security checks & update Linux daily)
    

----------

I am running for 1 slot (already active & notarizing) in: Asia.
