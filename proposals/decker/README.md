### Who am i? ###

I am an IT expert and systems engineer. I’ve formed part of the Komodo team since 2017. During which time I contributed to Komodo in the form of development towards the [KomodoQT](https://github.com/ip-gpu/KomodoOcean) (KomodoOcean) wallet - the **world's first GUI wallet** for a zero knowledge fork that supports KMD and all its parallel chains. Additionally I assist the team in testing and development of new dapps.

### Why Vote for Decker?  ###

In addition to the wallet development I took part in the creation of the first CHIPS wallet, building BarterDEXcore for Windows. Active member of the community with plans to support the platform in the long term. Notary node funds will increase my resources to improve Komodo dapps. 

### Proven Skills ###

- I can handle a wide spectrum of the Komodo infrastructure.
- Deployment and support fail-safe work of KMD and parallel chain explorers, hosted on my own servers and VDS.
- Software testing, software programming.
- Making blockchain snapshots, writing and translate documentations for users.

I’ve decided to become a candidate for the Asia and Russia / European region and I count on your support!

### Notary Node (Server Configuration) ###

This hardware is **already** owned, small photo gallery and "unboxing event" is available [here](https://deckersu.github.io/images/). In case if i'm not elected it will be used for deployment several points of network infrastructure like Iquidus explorers for assetchains, ElectrumX servers and others. One of the main aims is helping to strengthen Komodo network and related services, regardless of the election results.
