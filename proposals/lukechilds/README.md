## About Me

I'm an experienced software developer that's very active in the Open Source community and have been involved with cryptocurrencies since 2012. I work on Open Source almost full time, however I do some freelance work to cover my living costs.

I've made over 2000 contributions to Open Source software in the last year and have lots of my own projects published on [GitHub](https://github.com/lukechilds/). My Open Source modules get downloaded [millions of times a month](http://npm-stats.com/lukechilds).

My Open Source software is used in production by small developers and large companies all round the world. Some examples of companies that are using my software are:

- GitHub
- Ethereum
- Signal
- Facebook

I'm currently working on an alternative GUI implementation for Komodo's BarterDEX with a focus on simplicity, reliability and ease of use. I'm also doing extensive [debugging/testing/security auditing](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=repo%3Ajl777%2FSuperNET+author%3Alukechilds&type=Issues) with `marketmaker`.

### Contact Details

I'm @lukechilds on Slack, [GitHub](https://github.com/lukechilds), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lukechilds) and [Keybase](https://keybase.io/lukechilds). My personal email address is also listed on my GitHub profile.

## Why vote for me?

I'm a single individual running a single node in a single region for better decentralisation. I have the experience required to run a notary node properly and securely as outlined below.

If I'm elected I will be able to use the mining rewards to fund my work full time on Open Source and security research. I have many plans for Open Source projects that will benefit both the Komodo Platform and the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole.

## Server

- 16 Core CPU
- 64 GB RAM
- 1TB SSD

Will scale up as needed.

The server is hosted in Singapore in Asia. This strategic location gives lower latency connections to Bitcoin miners in China without being behind the Great Firewall of China itself.

## Experience

### System Administration

I'm very experience with system administration, I already run multiple nodes for other decentralised networks and have automated the process of running certain network services with my public Docker images.

#### Decentralised nodes

I have a proven track record of running decentralised nodes online with high uptime and high performance:

I've been running a Tor node since 2013. Due to high uptime and performance it was selected to be fallback directory mirror and is hard-coded into Tor's source code.

I also run a Vertcoin Electrum node. Likewise, this is [hardcoded](https://github.com/vertcoin-project/electrum-vtc/blob/44841d9668bd94f0a59fc311575770f29e73f6a1/lib/network.py#L57:5) into the Electrum-VTC source code as a bootstrap node due to high uptime and performance.

About 3 months ago, during excessive Vertcoin electrum traffic, all the electrum nodes went down apart from mine. My node (vtc.lukechilds.co) was single handedly processing all Vertcoin Electrum traffic and keeping everyone connected. [(proof)](https://www.reddit.com/r/vertcoin/comments/7j8l2h/working_electrum_nodes/)

#### Docker

I have published multiple public Docker images which have been downloaded over a million times.

I also built and maintain the official ElectrumX Docker image.

### Security

I also have good knowledge of network and application security. I have disclosed multiple vulnerabilities I've found in software.

#### Coinomi Mobile Wallet

I publicly disclosed the privacy issue of Coinomi leaking users wallet addresses in plain text after they ignored my multiple requests to reach out to them:

- https://cryptoinsider.com/content/coinomi-wallet-disclosure-denial-destructive-pr/index.html
- https://www.bitsonline.com/coinomi-vulnerability-respond/
- https://www.dashforcenews.com/coinomi-vulnerability-discovered-developers-react-harshly/
- https://cryptoble.win/2017/09/30/vulnerability-coinomi-devs-retaliate/

#### Buttercup Password Manager

I found and reported a vulnerability in a password manager's browser extension that would allow any website to read the entire contents of a users password store:

https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-browser-extension/issues/92

#### Agama

I found two high severity security vulnerabilities in Agama and have submitted fixes for them.

One was a remote code execution vulnerability giving certain sites the ability to take full control of your computer.

The other was a flaw in the authentication system that would allow an attacker to send you a URL that when opened would transfer all of your funds to them.

I have fixed both of these vulnerabilities but @jl777 has asked me not to go into more detail or publicly post proof of the vulnerabilities until more users have had time to update. He can verify that I found these issues.

#### BarterDEX

I found a vulnerability in `marketmaker`, the daemon that powers the BarterDEX network, that would allow a website to steal all your funds after you launch the daemon. I advised how to fix the issue and it was resolved many releases ago.

https://github.com/jl777/SuperNET/issues/563

## Disclosure

I am currently being funded by @pondsea for my development work on the new BarterDEX GUI. He is also running for election.
