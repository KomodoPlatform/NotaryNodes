## What's In It For You?

* **Voters will receive 25% revenue share of the node's mining income** proportional to their VOTE token contribution.  A website will be created to show all mining income for the node as well as an anonymous way to check your accumulated pending shares for payout. (Payout schedule TBD, but will lean towards higher frequency of payouts)
* Your support will help fund general Komodo development ideas that I am considering implementation of (e.g. block explorer for all asset chains, liquidity provider integration with exchange APIs)

## Why I'm a good candidate:

* Independent notary node operator
* 20 years of programming and web development experience
* 15 years server administration experience
* Learned about Komodo around the Beer/KMD event, completed many successful atomic swaps and have been a believer ever since
* Involved with cryptocurrency for over 5 years and over the past year started focusing on mining, trading and crypto related development
* A big advocate for digital privacy
* Currently 100% work from home and already managing 4 other production servers, so will be able to give full attention to node maintenance as needed
* At my workstation most waking hours and connected via mobile when I'm not

## Server Specs

_This server is currently up, running and notarizing on testnet as one of the top performers. I will upgrade the hardware as and when needed and will be able to perform such upgrades within a 24 hour turnaround time once the need is identified via my ongoing monitoring of the system._
