# What is IndéNodes?

1. IndéNodes is a [registered company in Neuchâtel](http://hrc.ne.ch/hrcintapp/externalCompanyReport.action?companyOfsUid=CHE-419.492.529&lang=EN), Switzerland. Our activities are fully declared and legalized. It gives us more facilities to interact with the institutions and doing business with the ‘non-crypto’ economy.
