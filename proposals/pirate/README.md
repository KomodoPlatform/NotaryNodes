## Disclaimer ##

#### We are running for election on behalf of the Piratechain Project ####

#### Pirate Development funds may be redirected towards other ecosystem projects provided our projects share mutual technical goals ####

#### Percentages may be adjusted based on market fluctuations as server costs are in FIAT ####
i.e.:
- if KMD price goes up Support & Node operations % goes down
- if KMD price goes down Support & Node operations % goes up

- We ensure full transparency, on request, in this matter; Main goal is to keep the servers at peak performance
