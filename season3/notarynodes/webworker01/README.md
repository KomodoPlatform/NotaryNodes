## About

webworker01 is a North American Notary Node operator since Spring of 2018. During that time he's continued to tinker and work on keeping his node operations at peak performance while learning and contributing to the Komodo ecosystem.

With modest server specs, daily attention to node operations allowed him to reach top performer in North America and #3 overall in the notary network for the 2018-2019 season.

## Vote2019 - Address: `RPyD36pL25mRh4uNR2AaEHfoUjVHYDUbVe` (SH)

For 2019 I propose the setup of one additional notary node in the Southern Hemisphere (SH).   Similar to my first notary node, I will once again choose a data center that is in a different location from all other operators. ~~I am currently investigating data centers in Kenya and South Africa and plan to look at options in South America as well.  Exact location will be decided and announced near the end of the voting period. System specs will be similar to the NA notary node I am currently managing (which will be upgraded this year to include 1TB NVME for storage).~~

After running for a second node I will not seek to run for any additional nodes. The proceeds from this second node will of course help with the cost of maintaining multiple vps and dedicated servers for the Komodo ecosystem as well as help fund additional development to enhance the project.  My first goal will be to rewrite komodostats.com source code and open source it so that some suggestions that didn't make it into the first version can be submitted by the community as well as have other instances run by other admins.

### Proposed Server Specs

* Processor: Intel Xeon E5-1620
* RAM: 64GB ECC DR
* Storage: SSD 1TB
* Networking: 200 Mbps uplink
* Data Center: Johannesburg, ZA

## Disclosure

I am not an official member of Komodo team, but a motivated contributor where my skills allow.
