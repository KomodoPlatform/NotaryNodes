My goal as a potential notary node operator is to add to ecosystem reliable and highly-available node and contribute to NN operators software.  

Part of the NN rewards I'm planning to spend on different testing bounties and community activities. For example ROGUE freeroll tournaments, crypto-conditions Tetris championship, crypto conditions modules testing bounties and so on.
 
I'm doer more than a speaker, so sorry if speech is too short :)

### Servers characteristics

On the start, I will use dedicated servers which met the requirements (Top-tier server CPU, 64+GB RAM, 1TB SSD + 1Gpbs uplink).
