### Disclosure: 
We thank our voters for the confidence in Chainmakers, which resulted in 2 notary spots in season 2. As keeping a notary re-elected for the next season falls on the shoulders of us, Chainmakers, we will not be airdropping any mining rewards from the automatically re-elected notary node or the node running as candidate for re-election this coming season.
