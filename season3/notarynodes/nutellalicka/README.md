## About Me

I have been interested and invested in cryptocurrency for about a year and a half, whilst being active in the Komodo community for over a year now. After seeing the technological advancements that Komodo was making, and seeing how the community came together to create, test and evaluate projects, I knew I wanted to be a part of this community. My first Komodo experience came through mining and trading. I purchased, built and ran multiple miners whilst I researched and learnt more about the code behind blockchain technology. I was introduced to the world of blockchain technology testing through the Proof Of Stake64 Test in 2018. I have to thank @Alright for walking me through how to install and run a full Komodo node for the first time, whilst also providing me an excellent opportunity to learn all things blockchain related. Since the POSTEST64 test event, I have provided time and effort towards a few different test events and projects. Most of my effort has gone towards the Komodo Assetchain, Pirate. I provided feedback and mining nodes on the initial startup of Pirate, I participated in the RKT z address sapling upgrade test net which directly led to identifying critical bugs that were fixed prior to mainnet introduction, as well as running a Pirate and Komodo mining pool. I created https://minethechains.com to provide the Komodo community with a one stop shop mining pool for KMD & it's assetchains. As of right now, it provides KMD & Pirate mining only, but will be implementing other KMD assetchains soon.

To summarise, ever since I was introduced to Komodo and it's community, I have been hooked. I would like the opportunity give back to through community engagement and providing my time to help with Komodo development. Although new to the blockchain world, the experience I have gained over the last year and a half has given me the required skills in order to effectively run and manage a Notary Node, and I would love to be given the opportunity to do so.

## My Notary Node Goal

My goal as a Komodo Network Notary Node is to provide a reliable, effective and efficient notarising node. The way I will achieve this is by maximising the uptime and productivity of my node through continual monitoring and optimising as required. I will be available every day on Discord and via email in case of any required changes, or coin additions. 


## Community Development Funds

Not only will I be dedicating my time and effort to work on various projects in the Komodo ecosystem, I will be dedicating 15% of my notary node mining rewards to support a fund for KMD ecosystem projects. This can be for dev costs/marketing initiatives /project improvement, etc. Initially this will be used to fund a gui developer for CHIPS. Following that, other KMD ecosystem projects will be able to apply to have KMD out of the fund.
If anyone has requests or suggestions for fund allocations, shoot me a message, I would love to hear your thoughts. I will be creating a webpage with the details of the wallet that will secure the funds, how many funds have been allocated, and to what projects, for transparency. 

## Server Specifications

I will be providing the Southern Hemisphere with a node located in a data centre in Brisbane. I believe this will aid in the decentralisation by providing another critical SH node that isn't located in Sydney.
