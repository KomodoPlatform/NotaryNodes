## Month 3 & 4

Month 3 & 4 have seen notarizations stats lower that needed. A change of servers is being considered depending on how optimizations currently being worked effect performance.

Donations will be combined for the last 2 months and this update are being combined due to time constraints and this will most likely continue.  Please contact node-9 for updates or questions.

Work with other Notary Node operators developing procedures and was the focus of the beginning of the 3rd month with a very strong focus on work for Komodo outside of the Notary Node arena. This will continue to be the main focus over the coming months.

## node-9 Donations

Node-9's 3rd and 4th round of donations are detailed below. As usual 20% of KMD mined are donated to the KMDLabs Dev Fund.

Thanks for your continued support!

    ===============================================

## Month 2

Month 2 proved to be very busy. Node-9 has been involved in preparing for a test of the updated version of the Iguana software used for notarizatioins.

Notarization count was slightly up this month to 558, but needs improvement to pull up in overall rankings. This improvement will be the goal from Month 3.

Node-9 has paid out its second round of donations.  20% of KMD mined are donated to  and you can find details of the payment below.

    ===============================================

## First month

The first month flew by. There were a few minor troubles that were dealt with but node-9 is performing well.

The goal for month 2 is to start pulling up towards the leaders. This will require some optimizations.

There may be some changes in how Notary Nodes are selected to be amongst the 13 who make the actual notarizations to BTC over the next 4~6 weeks. That may require some strategic and functional changes to ensure node-9's best performance.

# KMD NN Elections 2019

## Results (unofficial)
### node-9 won a spot!!

![Unoficial results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/node-prime/node-9/master/2019%20NN%20Election%20Results%20(unofficial).png)


## Thank you!

I am deeply humbled and grateful for all of the support that node-9 has received.  The election was very tight in the EU region and your VOTE2019 really counted.  Thank you very much.

The support node-9 has received goes back far beyond these elections.

One year ago I watched the Notary Node elections and thought to myself how cool it would be to play a part in supporting such a cause. I fantasized of myself having such a role. A pleasant distraction from the troubles I was having operating a simple GUI and navigating Slack.

The patience, help and encouragement that have been so freely given by the Komodo community and certain members in particular is a testament to the character of this project and the importance of its purpose.

To me the thing that has shone through the brightest in all of this has been people's willingness to give an 'anybody' a chance.  

I didn't expect that.

This experience has shown me a big part of what the 'blockchain revolution' and, more specifically, the Komodo project is about. It is something worth fighting for and I'll stand up and do my part. 

Thank you for giving me this hope and opportunity, and for your support.

### KMD Notary Node Proposal 2019

Thank you for checking out my Notary Node Proposal. Your votes would be greatly appreciated!
Please send them here:  
RBDivEArcb7aRsYTvtN5MRnaxeDAepSNmW                              ![n9 Address QR](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cris-F/NotaryNodes/master/notarynodes/node-9/n9_address_QR.png "node-9 vote address QR")
  
In this proposal I talk about myself a lot.  That just seems to be the clearest way to express what I am offering.  Please don't think I'm a narcissistic megalomaniac.
I am in fact far, far better than that.  
:wink: :wink:

### TL;dr  --  The Point

> The point of all of this is to give you one simple picture.
> **```I'll be there, I'll do the work and I'll push limits.```**
> You can check my record on this through Discord search, or

### How to participate
Information on how the NN elections work and how to vote can be found on the [Komodo website, here](https://komodoplatform.com/third-annual-notary-node-election/) and on [Komodoelection.com](https://komodoelection.com).  One KMD earns one vote token. It is possible to send portions of your vote tokens to multiple candidates. 

# Proposal

### Region: EU

### Purpose

As a Komodo EU Notary I will focus on notarizing.  Notarizing to the highest level I am able.  I will also support others in doing the same.  I believe that what we are creating here with Komodo is a very important step in the right direction.  As such, I take the responsibility of the role of Notary Node operator very seriously.
  
### Method

I will reliably put in the time and effort to do the best job I can possibly do.  This means being available when needed for updates, support and for active participation in the notary node community.  It also means I will do my best to improve my skills and hardware continually throughout the entire one year term.  Although these concepts may sound trivial and common, they are in fact not.  I believe my record, found through search or by asking around, will show that I am capable and willing to make this happen.

### Means
Through the use of a network of support I have developed and with the experience, skills and knowledge I have gained through working in KMDLabs as a Notary Node operator and basic tester I will continually optimize my node throughout the year, regardless of my notarization standings. I am not a dev or a very technical person but I have found out where and how to find and implement solutions to technical problems.

### Biography

The below accomplishments are very minor, without a doubt.  If you consider a start with absolute zero skill or knowledge of anything to do with computers, let alone blockchain and crypto, these accomplishments may take on a different perspective.

- mm1 stress test - received bug bounty for finding and reporting bug
- scaling test - one of very few to send a txBlast, participating where possible
- Pos64tests - actively participated in tests. Found minor bugs.  Only one to set up CC (dice) outside of 'official' test contract. 
- minor participation in PIRATE
  * setup a test chain for PIRATE NN tests (not used)
  * involved in deciding change to the current block reward
  * involved in PIRATE notarization testing in KMDLabs
- provide assistance in Discord ```'LANGUAGES AND LOCATIONS' #japanese``` channel
- KMDLabs
  * active participation in community
  * basic testing on setup of Labs
  * basic testing on first CCs
  * built and maintain [KMDLabs website](https://kmdlabs.com)
  * wrote, compiled or edited majority of content for website
  * setup and maintain [KMDLabs pad](https://kmdlabs.cc)
  * perform various non-dev jobs so devs can get on with devving
  
- basic testing on Marmara chain
- assisted in early Marmara documentation work
- mm2 community tester
- active in various KMD channels
- actively working with KMD team, outside of the online world, to bring business to KMD and its ecosystem

### Node
The exact details of the node I will be using will be finalized, should I be elected, after the election but well before going live on mainnet.  I expect an influx of new assetchains and and projects requiring dPoW over the coming year and will spec the server to meet this demand.  

Minimum specifications will be as follows:

| Specs | Details |
| ------ | ------ |
| CPU | Xeon/i7 (or equivalent AMD) |
| RAM | 128GB DDR4 ECC |
| Storage| 2 x 1TB SSD |
| Network | 1 Gbps |
| Location | EU datacentre |

### Pledge

If elected as a KMD Notary Node operator I pledge to donate 20% of the KMD mined by the node to [KMDLabs](https://kmdlabs.com) to be used to improve their infrastructure and their support for development initiatives.   

> [KMDLabs](https://kmdlabs.com) is a 'not for profit' testing ground for R&D
>  work on Komodo (KMD), Komodo based assetchains
> and Crypto-Conditions contracts. It also provides an
> incentivized test network, technical services and support
> knowledge base that will attract and onboard projects
> and developers to the Komodo ecosystem. It is not a
> business, but aims to provide free and very low cost
> services for development on the Komodo Platform.

### The Point

The point of this embarrassing self-aggrandizement is to give you one simple picture.

**```I'll be there, I'll do the work and I'll push limits.```**

Please send votes my way.
