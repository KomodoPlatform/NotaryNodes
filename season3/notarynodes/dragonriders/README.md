# Dragon Rider's Notary Node - Southern Hemisphere (SH)

## About me - patchkez

I am Open Source enthusiast and System Administrator. I am professionally working with *nix systems since 2006. In the past I have been working as Linux/Unix administrator, I was supporting critical Telco systems with tight SLAs. I am Red Hat Certified Engineer and certified in some Red Hat products (Ansible, Openstack, Pacemaker). I am not official Komodo team member and I am currently employed as Quality Engineer.

## Season 2 summary

I joined Komodo Slack channel on 8th of February 2018. After I read requirements for Notary Node I decided to participate in Notary Node elections. I had an idea to develop my Notary node by using containers technology. I shared this idea in komodo channel and found other candidate - Emmanux who wanted to do the same. So we formed team called Dragon Riders.

During the year I was involved in Komodo scaling testing where I cooperated mostly with [blackjok3r](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes/tree/master/notarynodes/blackjok3r). We used Kubernetes technology by Gooogle and AWS to spawn huge amount of komodo assetchains.

### HW specification
For season 2 I rented dedicated server in SH region with these parameters:
- Dual Intel Xeon E5-2620 v3
- 64GB RAM
- 2 x 512GB SSD
- redundant power supplies

The server was running pretty fine, there were only few outages caused by network issues in the datacentre.
You can find my server with name `patchkez_SH` in [komodostats](https://komodostats.com/).

## Season 3
Because my node ended in first half of SH Notary Nodes, it will be re-elected for season 3. I plan to upgrade my existing node to server with more recent CPUs, 128GB and 2x1TB SSD disks. I am looking forward to next season, as there will be more assetchains added which will force us to think about how we can scale our nodes better. Maybe I will end up with multiple servers instead of one.
